1
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:42,173
<i>A girl will never forget the
first boy she likes.</i>

2
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:47,157
<i>Even if things don't quite work out.</i>

3
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:49,793
Why did you do that?

4
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:52,063
Because you smell like dog poo.

5
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,962
You're so stupid, just like dog poo.

6
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,534
You're made out of poo!

7
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:01,232
<i>But usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom.</i>

8
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,636
Made...

9
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,174
...of...

10
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,976
...dog...

11
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:07,477
...poo.

12
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:08,945
Honey...

13
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:14,349
...do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things?

14
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,352
It's because he likes you.

15
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,753
<i>And there it is.</i>

16
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:21,554
<i>That's the beginning of our problem.</i>

17
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:27,864
That little boy is doing those terrible things
because he's got a crush on you.

18
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,365
<i>Do you know what this means?</i>

19
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:30,661
<i>We're all encouraged...</i>

20
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:31,996
<i>... no, programmed...</i>

21
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,696
<i>... to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk...</i>

22
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,342
<i>... that means he likes you.</i>

23
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:42,437
Here's the problem:
He likes you too much.

24
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,480
You're too pretty and too awesome.

25
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,743
- Yes.
- He can't handle it.

26
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:51,852
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

27
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,219
I'm sure he just lost your number.

28
00:01:55,761 --> 00:02:00,357
He's not asking you out because he's
intimidated by your professional success.

29
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:14,110
Trust me. It's because he's just
getting out of a serious relationship.

30
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:18,309
Trust me. It's because he's never had
a serious relationship.

31
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,831
<i>Why do we say this stuff to each other?</i>

32
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:36,460
<i>Is it possible that it's because
we're too scared...</i>

33
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:39,832
<i>... and it's too hard to say
the one obvious truth...</i>

34
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,998
<i>... that's staring everyone in the face?</i>

35
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,883
So Janine says
you're a real-estate agent.

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,290
Yeah, but I'm not
one of those cheesy ones...

37
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:07,397
...that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts.

38
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:09,897
So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?

39
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,092
Basically.

40
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,169
- It's much classier.
- My thoughts exactly.

41
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:19,536
Wonder why Janine never thought
to introduce us before.

42
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,474
I don't know. I don't know.

43
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,706
- Hey, guys. Want another round?
- You want one more?

44
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:31,049
Only if you do. I mean,
if you need to get going, I totally...

45
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:33,551
Uh...

46
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:36,318
Okay, well...

47
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,523
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

48
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:41,990
And a beer, please.

49
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,032
Be right back.

50
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:49,030
Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
- It was really nice meeting you.

51
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:51,639
- Bye.
- See you.

52
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:00,908
Hey, it's me.

53
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,520
He's cute, and I think it went well.

54
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:08,250
And I think he might be leaving me
a message at home as we speak.

55
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:12,487
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.

56
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:15,589
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
Conor. Thanks.

57
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,759
Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to grab a late bite.

58
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:21,467
Tonight? I...

59
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,700
No, I was supposed to meet friends
but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

60
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:28,505
<i>No, of course, I'm not mad.
Well, I'll be up for a while.</i>

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,580
<i>- Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- I'll be up.</i>

62
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:32,009
<i>- Oh, can you hold on?
- Okay.</i>

63
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:34,377
No, that's fine.
You just have one thing, so...

64
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,348
No, technically I have six...

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,081
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,
so I think you should go.

66
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:41,622
Okay.

67
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,054
Let me call you right back.

68
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,251
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

69
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,123
- Hi.
- Hey.

70
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,457
Just that and that, please.

71
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,463
Thank you.

72
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,136
Oh, my word.

73
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,408
Seriously? That's not possible.

74
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:02,602
I just deposited cash three days ago,
so it's just not possible.

75
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,577
Oh, it's not that.
Let me check something.

76
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,748
Congratulations, you won.

77
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:09,776
What?

78
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:14,014
Our Funky Fall promotion.
You're our 1000th customer this month.

79
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,749
What?

80
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,562
Are you kidding me?

81
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,894
I don't do kidding.

82
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:28,734
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this, it's so exciting.

83
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:33,009
Oh, my God.
I never won anything before.

84
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:36,613
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

85
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,711
Yea... No. I don't think so.

86
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,283
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:44,511
Thank you! Come here.

88
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,012
Wow.

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,853
<i>as the Terps move
to mid-ice, trying to...</i>

90
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,860
- Hey.
- Hey.

91
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:57,000
- How was the date?
- It was fine. Whatever.

92
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,135
- Why are you here?
- My cable's out.

93
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,636
Come on, Spiewak,
it's not the Ice Capades.

94
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:05,569
You didn't hear the phone ring
by any chance, did you?

95
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,073
- No, I didn't.
- Shit.

96
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,940
Anna gave me the old,
"I'll call you right back."

97
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,172
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?

98
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,115
That was 22 minutes ago.

99
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,010
Do I call back?

100
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:21,281
Should you call back? No, absolutely not.

101
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,958
I'm gonna call back
and say I'm going to bed.

102
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,891
What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna...?

103
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,224
No, it's a great idea.

104
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:32,424
I'll call and say, "In case you were
gonna call me back, don't...

105
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,729
...because I'll be sleeping."
A genius idea.

106
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,166
Okay, no, that's brilliant.

107
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,536
When you wake up you can say, "I'm awake
now, I'm available to take your call."

108
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,771
Oh, gosh. A second.

109
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,379
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

110
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:47,711
I was...

111
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,680
Wait, what was I saying again?

112
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,815
You don't wanna be like your mother,
wake up one morning...

113
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,923
...and realize
you never pursued your dreams.

114
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:56,353
Is that what I was saying?

115
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,152
- You want some gum?
- No, thank you.

116
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:02,161
God, that's kind of heavy
for a grocery chat.

117
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,561
- No, that's okay.
- Isn't it?

118
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,168
- Sorry.
- I actually might be able to help.

119
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:11,602
Yeah, I know a guy at my office
who deals exclusively with music clients.

120
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:12,866
- Are you kidding?
- Uh-uh.

121
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,703
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:17,175
- Are you my savior or something?
- No.

123
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,179
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,415
Oh, this is so unexpected.

125
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,723
Okay...

126
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:37,922
I don't...

127
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,301
I'm married.

128
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't do this.

129
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:46,104
You don't do what?
You don't help struggling singers?

130
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:53,312
Not hot yoga-instructing singers...

131
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,342
...who are incredibly charming.

132
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,684
Hm.

133
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,552
Well, you could...
You could give me your card.

134
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,126
That's legit, right? Is that allowed?

135
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,387
I could do that.

136
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,326
- Yeah.
- That'd be okay, right?

137
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,159
Yeah.

138
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,900
Great, thank you so much.

139
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,800
Course. Do you need help to your car?

140
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,236
- Where'd you park?
- No, I'm fine. It's okay.

141
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:23,643
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,473
Okay.

143
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,587
Who was that?

144
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:43,957
- Oh, that was a prospective client.
- Oh.

145
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,257
Okay.

146
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:50,464
I can talk to a woman.
It doesn't have to be like that.

147
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:52,538
No. Absolutely not.

148
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,972
- Just drive.
- Relax.

149
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,895
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,225
- How you doing?
- Good.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,369
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just got off the phone.

152
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,561
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my little sister.

153
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,639
- How's she doing?
- She's getting married.

154
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,574
Really?

155
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,142
Yeah.

156
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,437
Great.

157
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,012
You really think that's great?

158
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:35,773
Yeah.

159
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,076
Devon seems like...

160
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,981
...a great guy.

161
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:45,855
Well, so you think it's great
that they're getting married...

162
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:51,464
...but you don't ever feel like
we're going against nature, or something...

163
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,964
...by not getting married?

164
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,661
No.

165
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:02,106
Going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

166
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:06,542
You and I are just two people
who happen not to be married.

167
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:10,280
Let me tell you something. People
who get married are not to be trusted.

168
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,646
You are so weird.

169
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,048
They're not. You know why?

170
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,951
Because if you are so legitimately happy,
honestly...

171
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,820
...you wouldn't feel the need
to make a big show out of it.

172
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,688
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

173
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:23,625
They do it because they're insecure...

174
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:27,028
...and they think getting married's
what they're supposed to be doing.

175
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,761
So they're lying to themselves
and to other people.

176
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,268
Seriously.

177
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:34,805
Think about you and your friends.
Okay?

178
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:37,170
These women you have
great relationships with...

179
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,211
...you're close to them,
some of them you've known for years.

180
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,813
But you don't feel the need...

181
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:47,419
...to write a $45 check to the state
of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

182
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:49,248
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Right?

183
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,482
Why should it be any different,
you know, with me and you?

184
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:56,253
We're very happy, I love you,
I'm committed to you...

185
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,659
...we have a great life, you know?

186
00:10:58,831 --> 00:10:59,855
Yes, you're right.

187
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:03,126
Why can't we just be happy?

188
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,963
You're right.

189
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,731
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.
- Okay.

190
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,976
<i>Please enter your pass...</i>

191
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,674
<i>You have no messages.</i>

192
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:21,752
<i>Main menu. To send a message...</i>

193
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,782
Okay, so clearly he hasn't called.

194
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,757
Maybe he's away on business.

195
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,955
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

196
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,464
- Staying in town is his business.
- Right.

197
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,364
Well, look, let me tell you.

198
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:41,303
After I went out with Ben for the first
time, he didn't call me for 11 days.

199
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:43,999
Eleven days. And now
he's the world's best husband.

200
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,370
That happens all the time.

201
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:46,773
- Really?
- Really.

202
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,077
You want coffee?

203
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:51,716
- I got you 2 percent.
- Thanks.

204
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,813
This is all your fault.

205
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,821
What? Why?

206
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,516
You set us up.

207
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:07,530
No. You asked me if I know any guys,
and I gave Conor your phone number.

208
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,327
That's not a setup.

209
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:12,300
When I do a setup,
I weigh the pros and cons.

210
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,530
I do my due diligence.

211
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:19,166
All I know about Conor
is that he sold us this house.

212
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:25,205
Seriously, stop.

213
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,952
He said he always hangs out after work
at the City Supper Club.

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,350
Maybe I should do a little drive-by?

215
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:33,522
Please don't.

216
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:35,754
He'll call.

217
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,093
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

218
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,534
It's, like, who is this service helping?

219
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,571
I mean, for centuries...

220
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:53,838
Okay, well maybe not centuries,
but for, like, a lot and lot of years...

221
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:57,072
...people have been answering their phone,
not knowing who it is...

222
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,682
...and as far as I can tell,
no one's died from that.

223
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:04,550
And it's like if the police wanna know
who placed a call, they could trace it.

224
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,213
I mean, what am I, the police?

225
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:10,122
This constant obsession with needing
to know who's calling all the time...

226
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:11,557
...it's, like, so gross.

227
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,359
Like, you pick up the phone,
you find out who it is, then you know.

228
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,000
It's, like...

229
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,634
Look, all I'm saying...

230
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,406
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...

231
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:27,602
...to call him at 15-minute intervals
until he picks up.

232
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,906
But if he looks down
and sees my numbers...

233
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:33,380
...he's gonna think
I'm some kind of psycho or something.

234
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,683
Which I'm not.

235
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,549
Obviously.

236
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,193
Hello?

237
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,854
Mom.

238
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,967
I gotta call you back.

239
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:54,636
Inhale. Upward-facing dog.

240
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,171
Look up towards the ceiling.

241
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,105
Look up towards the ceiling.

242
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:03,045
He ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came.

243
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,147
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

244
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,806
He initiated the hug.
He said it was nice meeting me.

245
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:12,012
So wait. This was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date?

246
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,487
End. Why, does it matter?

247
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:17,991
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
of the date, that's normal.

248
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:20,426
"Nice meeting you"
at the end of the date...

249
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,488
It could be a blowoff.

250
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,532
Maybe it was at the beginning.

251
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,762
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

252
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:29,371
Or maybe it was at the end.

253
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,599
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

254
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:33,265
Help.

255
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,708
Hi. This is torture.

256
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,814
How am I supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic...

257
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:40,449
...to say about cinnamon blends?

258
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:42,084
It's hard to focus on nutmeg...

259
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:44,686
...when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams...

260
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:47,153
...refuses to call me.

261
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:49,925
After my first date with Neil...

262
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,118
...I called him.

263
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,090
There are no rules anymore.

264
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:57,859
And, I mean, why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass?

265
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,466
- It's ringing.
- That's pretty standard.

266
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,507
<i>- Hey, you've reached Conor.
- Yes! Voicemail.</i>

267
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,511
<i>- Leave a message, I'll get back to you.
- Notes.</i>

268
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,512
"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.

269
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,651
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...

270
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:20,051
...and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"

271
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,186
<i>What does that say? What's that say?</i>

272
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,358
Because we're all equal, right?

273
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,395
More than equal.

274
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:32,398
More women are accepted
into law school now than men.

275
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:35,002
<i>And, I mean, I don't know
if you saw that Dateline...</i>

276
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,833
...but women practically
have penises now, right? So...

277
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:39,965
Call me.

278
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,611
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.

279
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,912
Don't worry, he's totally gonna call.

280
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:07,968
What?

281
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:11,436
How can there not be a dial tone?
How can there not be a dial tone?

282
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:14,033
No dial tone. Come here, dial tone.

283
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,438
<i>Gigi, are you there?</i>

284
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,976
<i>Hello, Gigi?</i>

285
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:18,579
<i>- Mom, is that you?
- Yes.</i>

286
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:22,411
<i>- I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
- Wait, I need you to...</i>

287
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,650
<i>Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.</i>

288
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,227
Hi, Janine, it's me.

289
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:34,522
Conor never called...

290
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:39,430
...so I'm on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.

291
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:41,502
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

292
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:46,571
All right, I'm interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance. Bye.

293
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,438
What's up, girl?
- Hey.

294
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,776
- How are you?
- Good.

295
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:01,914
Knock, knock.

296
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,455
Hey.

297
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:05,859
So...

298
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:09,161
...here we are. Same shift again.

299
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,596
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

300
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:17,169
Well, I figured it was no coincidence.

301
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,204
I had...

302
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,478
...a good time the other night.

303
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:27,141
Yeah.

304
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:29,875
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patrón will get you.

305
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:35,649
So I was thinking...

306
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,920
...after work we could...

307
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:40,985
You know...

308
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:47,692
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

309
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,029
It was definitely fun.

310
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:52,105
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

311
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:55,300
So that's why I scheduled you.

312
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,342
To work.

313
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,139
So...

314
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,245
Are we good?

315
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,711
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

316
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,116
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

317
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,690
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

318
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,036
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or?

319
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:25,536
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

320
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,174
Why?
- Hm?

321
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,207
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

322
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,003
I'll wait at the bar.

323
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,105
That's a great idea.

324
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,855
What can I get you?

325
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,424
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

326
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,289
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

327
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,027
I don't know if you'd call it "hot."

328
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,463
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time...

329
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,227
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

330
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,694
Yeah.

331
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,862
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

332
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,600
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

333
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:06,644
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

334
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,839
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting."

335
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,075
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

336
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,414
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

337
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,887
Okay.

338
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,855
I just was actually in the area...

339
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:23,292
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

340
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:27,764
Because I had to return his pen.

341
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,033
Had to return this pen. He left this.

342
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:35,164
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

343
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,771
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

344
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,770
Thanks.

345
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:45,617
"Wilson Ward, DDS,
Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry."

346
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,054
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

347
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,749
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

348
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,655
Oh, really. Who is?

349
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,121
My dad.

350
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,363
Oh.

351
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,906
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

352
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,477
And I just...

353
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,081
I thought if I just ran into him...

354
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,011
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

355
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,815
Wait.

356
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,014
Wait, just...

357
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,284
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

358
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,020
One drink. Okay?

359
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,129
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

360
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:40,868
Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

361
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,338
Conor's never gonna call you.

362
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,103
Oh, really. How do you know?

363
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,804
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

364
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,448
He said it was nice meeting me.

365
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,141
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

366
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,651
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

367
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,985
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

368
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,786
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

369
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,360
Or maybe he lost my number...

370
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,556
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

371
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,725
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

372
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,334
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

373
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,067
She totally wrote him off.

374
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,939
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

375
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,774
She ran into him,
and it ended up that...

376
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,610
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

377
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,775
...by the way.
The rare exception.

378
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,820
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

379
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,753
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

380
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:37,328
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

381
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,124
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,094
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

383
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,293
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

384
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,938
I do it early, I do it often.

385
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:52,566
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

386
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,235
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

387
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,278
No exceptions.

388
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,187
Thank you.

389
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,487
Given me a lot to think about.

390
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,838
Morning, morning.
- Excuse me.

391
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,166
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,602
Everything okay?

393
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,901
Oh, I was up all night.

394
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,101
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

395
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,407
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

396
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,447
Sweetie?
What's going on with your hair?

397
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,950
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

398
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,782
Okay.

399
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,287
So...

400
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,624
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

401
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,923
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

402
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:51,398
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

403
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,664
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

404
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,707
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

405
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,811
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

406
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,947
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

407
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,174
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

408
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,579
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

409
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,552
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

410
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:17,558
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

411
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:20,253
And then... Oh, there was Don...

412
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:23,992
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

413
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,068
I was delusional about that relationship.

414
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,728
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

415
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:31,170
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

416
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,970
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

417
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,942
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

418
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:39,082
...and that girl ended up getting married.

419
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,310
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

420
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:51,123
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

421
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,995
So what you're saying is...

422
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:56,462
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

423
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,159
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

424
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,963
Yes.

425
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:04,005
But the rule are guys like Neil...

426
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:08,107
...who are with girls like me...

427
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,804
...for seven years and aren't married...

428
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,539
...they're never getting married.

429
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,382
- No.
- No.

430
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,075
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

431
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:20,121
- It's not what she meant in that...
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

432
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,418
I absolutely was not talking about you.

433
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:26,529
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

434
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,291
Just me specifically, you know?

435
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:36,399
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

436
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,838
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

437
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,106
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

438
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,272
And then he tells me that he's married.

439
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,883
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

440
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,078
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

441
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,449
But he's married.

442
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:57,059
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

443
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:58,488
What's wrong with me?

444
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,519
Okay.

445
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,462
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

446
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:09,230
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

447
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:14,104
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

448
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:18,611
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

449
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:22,149
That he had finally met the one.

450
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,081
So he divorced his wife...

451
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:27,518
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

452
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,988
...and they're insanely happy.

453
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,753
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

454
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:35,022
...but you already married someone else?

455
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:37,325
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

456
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,105
You're right. Okay.

457
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:44,932
I'm gonna call him.

458
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,266
Okay.

459
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,116
<i>Hello?
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.</i>

460
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:07,694
<i>Hey, Anna. What's up?</i>

461
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:10,958
Nothing, I was just...
I was taking you up on your offer.

462
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:15,571
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

463
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:21,004
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

464
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,443
<i>Look, I just...</i>

465
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,251
<i>I can't, Anna.</i>

466
00:26:31,386 --> 00:26:33,911
<i>You seemed great. I just... I don't know.</i>

467
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,057
<i>I should probably go.</i>

468
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:37,919
<i>Take care, though. Bye.</i>

469
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:46,927
- Hey.
- Hey.

470
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:48,501
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

471
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,104
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

472
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:52,934
I was just thinking about you.

473
00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:54,905
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

474
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:56,907
Okay, what were the categories again?

475
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:58,909
Four categories:

476
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,641
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

477
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:04,979
But you can only be two things.

478
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:09,487
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

479
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,626
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

480
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,624
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

481
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,319
Go. What am I?

482
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:16,657
Wait, what was I again?

483
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,663
You're smart and cute.

484
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,860
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

485
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:23,561
And cute.

486
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:26,235
No, you can't...

487
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,535
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

488
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,473
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

489
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:34,604
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,
which obviously you are.

490
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,978
Especially sexy.

491
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:38,983
You're the best.

492
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:45,716
I better go.

493
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:50,087
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

494
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,530
What? It's been a while.

495
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,429
No, I can't.

496
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:57,036
I can't stay, I'm totally...

497
00:27:57,204 --> 00:27:58,796
I'm totally, totally fried.

498
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:00,167
Is that okay?

499
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:01,774
Yeah.

500
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,905
I'll see you later.

501
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,515
Bye.

502
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:21,452
Hey.

503
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:23,586
That look straight to you?

504
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:25,959
Why are you hanging that?

505
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,995
Because you asked me to
about three weeks ago.

506
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,365
I'm getting around to it.

507
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,565
Why? You don't want it here?

508
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:36,437
No, I love it there. But just stop.

509
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:39,068
Why? Is it the painting?

510
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:44,206
You know, I know, it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here.

511
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,682
Right? I know.

512
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:48,321
It's gonna be depressing.
Should I take it down?

513
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:52,356
No, I want you
to stop doing anything nice.

514
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:56,524
This feels like a trick.

515
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,164
- No.
- No?

516
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:02,325
No, I just... I just need you
to stop being nice to me...

517
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,494
...unless you're gonna marry me after.

518
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,197
Is that funny?

519
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,842
Do you think that's funny?

520
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:13,369
No, I guess it's not funny.

521
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,481
See, you can't keep being nice to me...

522
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,346
...and I can't keep pretending
that this is something that it's not.

523
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,814
We've been together
for over seven years.

524
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,514
You know me, you know who I am.

525
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:27,524
You either wanna marry me
or you don't.

526
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,395
Or there's the possibility...

527
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:35,897
...that I mean it when I say
I don't believe in marriage...

528
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:37,536
Bullshit.

529
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:38,728
Bullshit.

530
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,237
Come on, it's bullshit for every woman...

531
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:45,002
...that has been told by some man
that he doesn't believe in marriage...

532
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:50,639
...and then six months later he's married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

533
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:52,717
It's just... It's bullshit.

534
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,352
Where is this coming from?

535
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,546
From the place I've been hiding
from you for about five years.

536
00:29:57,724 --> 00:29:58,748
Okay.

537
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,519
Five years, because I haven't wanted
to seem demanding.

538
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:06,290
And I haven't wanted
to seem clingy or psycho.

539
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,591
Or whatever.

540
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,895
So I haven't asked you.

541
00:30:12,205 --> 00:30:13,968
But I...

542
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,872
I have to.

543
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,176
I mean...

544
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:26,650
...are you ever gonna marry me?

545
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:47,305
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

546
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:07,284
<i>I used to think that I had
never been dumped.</i>

547
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,450
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.

548
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:13,655
Then we realized we've both been dumped
by every man we've ever been with.

549
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,459
- Every one.
- Yeah.

550
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:18,159
- But they do it so skillfully.
- Mm-hm.

551
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,669
They just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea.

552
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,070
Yeah. You're sitting back
and you're like:

553
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:28,110
"Oh, yeah. This my idea.
But wait a second, why am I alone?"

554
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,771
"Why am I unhappy?
Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

555
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,349
- They Jedi mind-trick you.
- Yes, they do.

556
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:34,951
- So they do a soft pass.
- Yeah.

557
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,179
They got little lines they like to tell you.

558
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,220
Like, "I don't wanna stand in your way."

559
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:42,792
Or, "You're perfect,
it's just I have to work on myself."

560
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:45,020
Right. "I'm just thinking
of your happiness."

561
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,791
"Oh, I don't deserve you."
That's my favorite one.

562
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,365
You know the other one I like?

563
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:52,002
"I am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you."

564
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,967
- Well, that could have been you.
- Yeah.

565
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:55,834
That's what I was leaning towards.

566
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:57,975
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

567
00:31:58,143 --> 00:32:01,135
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream...

568
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:03,042
...because you have been dumped.

569
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,640
Hey Anna, it's Ben.

570
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,718
Listen, I know it's been a while
since you called.

571
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:11,981
It's just... It took me by surprise.

572
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:14,557
But I did offer to help you
with your career...

573
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,819
...and I don't see why
I can't do that, right?

574
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:18,587
So why don't you give me a call...

575
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:21,289
...and maybe you can
come by the office or something.

576
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:23,957
Okay? All right, take care. Bye.

577
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:25,262
Hey, you.

578
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:27,462
Oh, shit.

579
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,574
- What?
- You scared me.

580
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,573
- You okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,574
Everything's fine.

582
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,141
Are you smoking again?

583
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:38,372
No, sweetie, I'm not smoking.

584
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:39,573
Why?

585
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,240
You get jumpy when you smoke.

586
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,010
I'm not smoking, I promise.

587
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,246
No, I was just sitting here...

588
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:49,085
...trying to picture what this room's
gonna look like when it's finished.

589
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,522
- I like that game.
- You do?

590
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:52,093
Yeah.

591
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:55,722
What color did you picture?

592
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,868
That's where I got stuck.

593
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:59,434
Yeah.

594
00:33:00,571 --> 00:33:02,539
I was thinking...

595
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,837
...maybe yellow.

596
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,411
- Yellow? Okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.

597
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,414
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. So it could be whatever.

598
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:17,076
It could be an office,
it could be a guest room...

599
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:19,950
...a gym, a baby's room...

600
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:26,695
Wait, did you mean "neutral,"
or "gender-neutral"?

601
00:33:26,864 --> 00:33:30,425
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

602
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:35,065
I know we said
we'd wait to talk about it.

603
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,968
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

604
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:43,576
But I think that we're almost ready
to start talking about it.

605
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:02,524
So that's the last time
I do anything pro bono.

606
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:08,794
Well, ladies, I guess
I have to get back to the office.

607
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:12,636
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?

608
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,367
I met you.

609
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,170
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?

610
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,177
- Of course.
- Oh, great.

611
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,515
Here is my info.

612
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,615
- Nice to meet you, Janine.
- Nice to meet you.

613
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:31,020
Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

614
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:34,719
Oh, wait.

615
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,462
So...

616
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,300
...how are we doing this?

617
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,461
Are you hearing from me
or am I getting a call?

618
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,663
What?

619
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:45,834
You said you'd love to call me...

620
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:48,910
...but then you said,
"Look forward to hearing from you," and...

621
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:50,978
You see how that's kind of confusing?

622
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:54,014
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

623
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,512
You did it again. Very vague.

624
00:34:57,687 --> 00:35:00,349
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me...

625
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:03,117
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.

626
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:05,158
Goodbye, Gigi.

627
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,901
- He was cute.
- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.

628
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,935
What are you doing?

629
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:24,272
I'm not calling him.

630
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,745
If he wants to see me, he'll call.

631
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:28,211
Wow.

632
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,410
That guy Alex really
made an impression on you.

633
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,781
Was he hot?

634
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,481
No. He was just...

635
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:36,852
...right.

636
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:39,859
Morning.

637
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,620
Morning, Ryan.

638
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:44,664
A surprise mocha venti
just because you're so awesome.

639
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,267
- Love you.
- Love you.

640
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:49,533
Good morning.

641
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,941
Okay.

642
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,644
So?

643
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:08,747
Oh, hi.

644
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:16,558
- He asked me out.
- Oh, my God. He called?

645
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,261
Well...
- He e-mailed?

646
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:21,925
- No.
- What?

647
00:36:22,104 --> 00:36:24,129
Left his calling card
with your lady-in-waiting?

648
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:29,106
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.

649
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:33,643
- Oh.
- Oh, girl, I don't know about that.

650
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:37,444
My trampy little sister says
MySpace is the new booty call.

651
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:40,855
Well, what am I supposed to do?

652
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,650
I mean, things have changed.

653
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:45,156
People don't meet each other
organically anymore.

654
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:49,286
If I would like to make myself seem
more attractive to the opposite sex...

655
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:52,524
...I don't go and get a new haircut,
I update my profile.

656
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,601
That's just the way it is, you know?

657
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:57,165
Yeah, she's right.

658
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:59,603
Back, back, back, back.

659
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,673
Ad sales, this is Mary.

660
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:07,008
Hi, Mary, this is Conor,
Anna's friend, or whatever.

661
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:08,206
<i>Hi.</i>

662
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:11,108
So, what'd you think?

663
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,618
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.

664
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:15,050
Oh, you have to trust me.

665
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:17,782
It's a burgeoning market,
you're gonna make a fortune.

666
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,086
I know. Did you have to put me
with the massage ads?

667
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:24,823
Well, it was either that or the page
with the personals, so...

668
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:26,864
<i>This page gets a lot of action.</i>

669
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,865
Yeah, I guess you're right.

670
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:30,697
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?

671
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,498
Yeah.

672
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,035
Okay.

673
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,508
All right, Mary,
I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

674
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,113
<i>Bye.</i>

675
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:44,977
What I'm trying to show you is
that there's a difference.

676
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:46,950
There is a difference.

677
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:50,955
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda
to sew these dresses in two weeks?

678
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,353
She wanted to do it.

679
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,893
Really? She told me she felt like
an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

680
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:57,826
- Is that not right?
- No, she didn't.

681
00:37:57,998 --> 00:37:59,090
No?

682
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:03,498
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?

683
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:08,005
Because I am not having my wedding
during a gross Baltimore winter...

684
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:10,040
...and I am not waiting till spring.

685
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,202
You are so pregnant.

686
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:13,903
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.

687
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:16,049
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

688
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,412
- Chug a beer then.
- No, I'm not chugging a beer.

689
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:19,610
Chug a beer.

690
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:21,516
We're in love, you assholes.

691
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:25,250
That's what people do
when they're in love, they get married.

692
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:31,690
But you know what?
Not everybody gets married, you know?

693
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:35,358
There are many people
who never get married.

694
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,168
Well, thanks
for the inspirational pep talk.

695
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,400
What she meant to say was that it's fine
that you broke up with Neil.

696
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:43,600
Right.

697
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:46,541
Tons of people make the choice
to be alone. They're happy.

698
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:49,142
Look at Al Pacino.

699
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:52,580
Never been married, happy as a clam.

700
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:56,381
Would that...? Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

701
00:38:56,556 --> 00:38:58,649
No, Bethie, we just...
We want you to be happy.

702
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:02,118
Well, then you should have
rethought the coral.

703
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:04,195
Oh, her face.

704
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:05,797
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.

705
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,956
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

706
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:11,069
I know, you're sensitive.
Trust me, I get it.

707
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:14,832
Hey, why don't you have dinner
with me and Steven and the kids...

708
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:16,532
...then you can just stay over...?

709
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,075
Why'd she wanna hang out
with you and your husband?

710
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:20,837
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

711
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:22,914
If being in this wedding is too painful...

712
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:26,711
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it.
Relax, relax.

713
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:29,485
That's enough, okay?
Seriously, you guys, I'm f...

714
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:33,820
I've gone through breakups before.
If you remember, I handle them quite well.

715
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:38,327
You've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

716
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,090
I can do it again.

717
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:42,461
I want you to stop worrying about me.

718
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:44,500
I'm fine.

719
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:47,498
I know it's here somewhere.

720
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:52,737
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.

721
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:58,049
Well, that's okay.
You can just call me when you find it.

722
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:03,852
I swear I didn't lure you here
under false pretenses.

723
00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:05,752
I know.

724
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,290
A girl can dream, though.

725
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,356
You're just too good a guy.

726
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,333
Why are you married again?

727
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:25,436
Seriously, why?

728
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,307
No, I really think
that it would be good for me to know...

729
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,347
...why you cannot live
without this other woman.

730
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:37,915
Well, we'd been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum.

731
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,685
She said, "Either we get married
or we break up."

732
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,225
So we got married.

733
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,360
Wow. You caved.

734
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,726
It's complicated.

735
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:51,635
Really?

736
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:57,198
What? You're a dick if you date a girl
for too long and don't marry her.

737
00:40:57,776 --> 00:41:00,870
You marry her and you're an asshole
for marrying before you're ready.

738
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:04,482
I mean, shit, I don't know.

739
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:19,525
You're really hot.

740
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:23,232
And I am obviously attracted to you.

741
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,836
So I think the best I can do is...

742
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:32,573
...eventually find this piece of paper
and call you...

743
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:36,874
...and hope to just help you out in
your career in some small way.

744
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:48,917
Hi.

745
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:51,221
Hi. What's going on?

746
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:01,799
Javier.

747
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:07,135
Javier, I thought we talked
about tarping the furniture.

748
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:50,411
City Supper.

749
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:52,453
<i>Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?</i>

750
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:54,090
Hold on.

751
00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:56,055
- Alex?
- Yo.

752
00:42:56,227 --> 00:42:58,161
- Drinks are good?
- Yeah, one more.

753
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:00,320
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, this is Gigi.</i>

754
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:02,329
<i>- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.</i>

755
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,128
- Huh?
- I, um...

756
00:43:05,302 --> 00:43:06,792
...had the dentist pen.

757
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:09,132
<i>Right. Hey. How you doing?</i>

758
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:12,104
<i>- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.</i>

759
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:15,473
You had some really good insights
and I wanted to ask you a question.

760
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:18,137
Okay, look, now I need
to be harsh with you.

761
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:20,840
Conor's never gonna be
interested in you, Geege.

762
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:24,044
No, I know. This is about Jarrad.

763
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:25,313
<i>Jarrad.</i>

764
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:28,390
So we meet at happy hour
and he's completely charming...

765
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,494
Hey, give me two seconds, okay?
Two seconds, hold on.

766
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:43,796
Let me guess. He said:

767
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:46,407
"The only thing happy
about this hour is you."

768
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:50,435
He might have used
some derivative of that.

769
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:57,275
So he says he's going to call, but then
he gives me his card and he says...

770
00:43:57,454 --> 00:43:58,944
<i>Oh, he's not interested.</i>

771
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:01,920
- You don't even know if he's called.
- Oh, did he?

772
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:03,549
No.

773
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:07,085
<i>- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.</i>

774
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:11,563
Gigi, he is not interested.

775
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:14,163
Alex, this is jacked.

776
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:17,101
The hostess is giving me shit
for not wearing a black shirt.

777
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:18,672
- It's not black.
- Look at it.

778
00:44:18,842 --> 00:44:21,811
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

779
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,639
This shit is black.

780
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,750
If a guy gives you his phone number
instead of taking yours, he's not interested.

781
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,512
He took mine first. Then he gave...

782
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:36,147
<i>And also, if a guy wants to see you,
believe me, he will see you.</i>

783
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:42,129
I once called 55 Lauren Bells
until I got the right one.

784
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:43,993
That's cute.

785
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:45,225
What happened?

786
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:48,859
Oh, yeah, as it turns out,
her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

787
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:53,642
Is it your sensitivity that makes you
so popular with women?

788
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,309
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

789
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:58,474
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

790
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:01,276
<i>- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know. Thank you.</i>

791
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,883
Sure.

792
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,815
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.

793
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:07,785
Okay, bye.

794
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:13,422
Hey, buddy, you home?

795
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:15,825
Yeah. Come on in.

796
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:20,930
Hey, you want a beer?

797
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:24,732
Or an apple martini?

798
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:26,238
Oh, that's funny.

799
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:29,939
Have you told your parents?

800
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:32,637
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.

801
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,611
By pretending to be gay?

802
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:37,479
No, by being more gay-friendly.

803
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:39,712
Or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent."

804
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:41,480
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

805
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:44,091
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.

806
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,820
I don't know. Dressing like that,
seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

807
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,463
...I think you can pull it off.

808
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,826
It's not that she won't sleep with me,
douche bag.

809
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,468
I have slept with her.
It's just she, you know...

810
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,495
Won't sleep with you anymore.

811
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,906
Pretty much, yeah.

812
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:02,033
What do you think?

813
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,575
I think you got a problem...

814
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:07,806
...because you're gonna have to beat them
away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.

815
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:09,245
Holy shit.

816
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:11,946
Observe your breath.

817
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:15,521
Inhale, belly rise.

818
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:20,820
And exhale, belly fall.

819
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:24,826
Bring your hands together
in front of your chest.

820
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:28,161
Bow your head in gratitude.

821
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:35,239
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

822
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,502
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.

823
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:42,939
Great class.

824
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:56,863
We ran into each other.

825
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,195
You came to my class.

826
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:01,693
I had no idea this was your class.

827
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,705
You called to ask me
if this was my class.

828
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,238
No, you never called back.

829
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,343
Because you told me not to call you
if it was my class. It was.

830
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:12,809
- No. We just ran into each other.
- Okay.

831
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,610
We're just two innocent folks who happen
to be working out near each other.

832
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,753
Exactly.

833
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:23,084
Do you want a swim?

834
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,282
Sure.

835
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,733
You know, I was just thinking...

836
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,767
...why can't we be friends?

837
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:40,564
I mean, am I not allowed
to have friends anymore?

838
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:44,842
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends
with people that are hot?

839
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:47,708
I mean, what kind of
reverse prejudice is that?

840
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:49,076
I hear you.

841
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,740
I mean...

842
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:54,319
...am I not supposed to be friends
with a guy just because he's married?

843
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:55,512
Right.

844
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,590
Or has an insane smile?

845
00:47:57,758 --> 00:48:00,124
Or an ass that makes me
wanna dry hump?

846
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:08,766
- Did you just say "dry hump"?
- Yeah.

847
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:13,770
Think I just fell in love.

848
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,143
So we're friends.

849
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:24,278
Yeah.

850
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:00,984
You wanna come in?

851
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,553
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.

852
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:09,991
That's okay. You can just watch.

853
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:15,534
You know, you may be
the best friend I've ever had.

854
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:29,313
- Hi.
- Hey.

855
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:38,022
Take a shower. Hey.
- What? Hi.

856
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:40,182
- Honey?
- Yeah.

857
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:43,859
You smell weird.

858
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,122
- I smell weird?
- Yeah, different.

859
00:49:46,298 --> 00:49:49,529
- Different how?
- I don't know.

860
00:49:51,303 --> 00:49:52,793
Sort of an odd thing to say.

861
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:56,270
You know, maybe it was the ashtray
and cigarettes I found.

862
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:58,375
In the back yard.

863
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:02,535
What part of
"My dad died of lung cancer"...

864
00:50:02,714 --> 00:50:05,706
...is so hard for you
to wrap your brain around?

865
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:06,908
What?

866
00:50:07,085 --> 00:50:10,577
Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?

867
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:16,895
Are you serious?

868
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:25,602
We have, like, 8000 undocumented
workers here daily.

869
00:50:25,771 --> 00:50:30,435
Okay, and you find an ashtray
with cigarettes in it and you think...

870
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:33,669
You automatically assume
that they're mine.

871
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:35,404
Oh, yeah.

872
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:37,674
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

873
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:44,416
I think...

874
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:47,420
...you are really freaking out.

875
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:51,593
This whole renovation thing's getting
to you because nothing's happening.

876
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:59,234
Just say no.

877
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:00,632
Get it out.

878
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:01,966
Gonna take a shower.

879
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,873
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

880
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,679
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

881
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,723
Who'd have thought that a random girl
from yoga...

882
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:27,797
...would fix me up with such a good kisser?
- Back at you, sister.

883
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:32,996
I can't wait to kiss you again.

884
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:35,230
But we're kissing right now.

885
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:36,566
I know, next time.

886
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:39,437
The second-date kiss
is way more intimate.

887
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:42,607
Well, listen...

888
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,272
...I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

889
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,653
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.

890
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:53,283
Okay.

891
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:12,667
Oh, yeah.

892
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:13,901
Yeah?

893
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:16,842
Hey, sorry to bug you again.
Quick question.

894
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:19,312
Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.

895
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,417
What's going on?

896
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:24,611
Okay, I'm making out with this guy...
PG stuff.

897
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:28,225
And he mentions that he's going
out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.

898
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:29,518
Run.

899
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,285
But maybe he is going out of town.

900
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:35,057
Where? Where's he going
that he's gonna be out of touch?

901
00:52:37,735 --> 00:52:39,600
Where are you going
out of town to again?

902
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,034
Um... Uh... Pittsburgh.

903
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:44,734
Pittsburgh.

904
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,035
Run.

905
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,646
So, what, now I'm just supposed to run
from every guy who doesn't like me?

906
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:51,907
Yeah.

907
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:55,410
There's not gonna be anybody left.

908
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:58,716
I don't know why I'm saying this...

909
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,721
...but I think I know a nice guy
who might actually like you.

910
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:03,586
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

911
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,853
<i>He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.</i>

912
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:08,554
<i>We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.</i>

913
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:12,759
So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom
right now.

914
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:13,960
<i>What do I do?</i>

915
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:18,267
Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
But I'd take my time in there.

916
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,505
<i>I'd let him sweat.</i>

917
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,941
<i>- Thanks.
- Good luck.</i>

918
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:54,772
Yeah, the boat looks great.

919
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,468
You look like shit.

920
00:53:56,646 --> 00:53:58,546
But your boat looks great.

921
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:02,515
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.

922
00:54:02,685 --> 00:54:04,812
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

923
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:07,252
A lot of time to work on the place.

924
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:09,255
You should try working on a shower.

925
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:11,018
Yeah.

926
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:14,387
Hey, what can I tell you?

927
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:18,500
Standing on principle, man. It's all I got.

928
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,128
Cigarette?

929
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:25,500
No, I'm good.

930
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:28,006
That's right, you quit.

931
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,634
Good for you.

932
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:40,882
So did Janine send you out here
to check up on me?

933
00:54:41,523 --> 00:54:43,320
Yeah, pretty much.

934
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,357
What are you gonna tell her?

935
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:49,358
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look
out here on the ocean.

936
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:52,690
Break.

937
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:54,665
Any word from Beth?

938
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:59,607
She's so busy organizing
her sister's funeral, I think she must be...

939
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:00,867
Sister's what?

940
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,034
Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.

941
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,840
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said "funeral."

942
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:07,572
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

943
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:09,376
Shit, did I really?

944
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:11,746
That's so weird.

945
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,417
I don't understand
why people wanna get married.

946
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:17,550
They don't.

947
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,250
- They don't?
- No.

948
00:55:19,795 --> 00:55:22,787
No, no guy actually wants to get married.

949
00:55:22,965 --> 00:55:26,162
And if they do,
all they're really thinking about?

950
00:55:26,335 --> 00:55:28,530
All the women
they're gonna miss out on.

951
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:30,899
I don't wanna be with anybody else,
just Beth.

952
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:34,639
I don't know, man, I...

953
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,471
Why'd you get married?

954
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,614
I love Janine.

955
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:42,409
You're a happily married guy.

956
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

957
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,078
Yeah, I'd say so.

958
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:55,756
Now, I know I don't need
to tell any of you...

959
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:59,593
...that my cousin Paige is hot.

960
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:04,700
In high school, if I told the popular guys
that Paige was my cousin...

961
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:06,931
...it'd keep me
from getting my ass kicked...

962
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:09,838
...because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her.

963
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:16,076
And when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to Devon...

964
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,946
...there will be hearts breaking
all over the world.

965
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,985
Hear, hear.
- That's sweet.

966
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:27,793
But, you know, keep in mind
that her sister Beth is still on the market.

967
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:31,693
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...

968
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:34,596
...but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank.

969
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:36,498
But don't stay on the lot too long...

970
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:39,606
...or next year's models are gonna
slip in there and steal all...

971
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:41,765
Okay, that's enough of the speeches.

972
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:42,967
Okay.

973
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:45,044
So enjoy the crab.

974
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:50,947
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,
it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

975
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:55,851
Bethie.

976
00:56:57,258 --> 00:57:00,091
Your cousin Jay
has always been a jackass.

977
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:01,285
I know.

978
00:57:01,762 --> 00:57:04,026
And somehow even he's married.

979
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:07,864
Oh, honey, look.

980
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:11,493
Back when everyone
was just going to camp at the Y...

981
00:57:11,672 --> 00:57:13,663
<i>...you borrowed my New York Times...</i>

982
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:16,207
...found some arts camp
in the Berkshires...

983
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:19,540
...wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own.

984
00:57:19,714 --> 00:57:22,376
You never did things like everyone else.

985
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,847
Why not?

986
00:57:24,018 --> 00:57:25,542
Because that's you.

987
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:28,920
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

988
00:57:29,523 --> 00:57:31,990
You're not supposed to say that.

989
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:33,989
I don't give a shit.

990
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,685
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

991
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:38,854
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

992
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:41,796
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

993
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:43,833
It's true, though.

994
00:58:01,154 --> 00:58:02,178
Hey.

995
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:06,288
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

996
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,861
Come on.

997
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,260
Sorry I'm late.

998
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:18,768
No, it's okay.

999
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:20,872
I like a little time before a blind date.

1000
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:24,738
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

1001
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,139
Gigi, he's not coming.

1002
00:58:26,313 --> 00:58:29,510
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1003
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:31,446
Hey.

1004
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:33,313
How could he already not like me?

1005
00:58:33,486 --> 00:58:36,717
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1006
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,289
Hi. Are you good?

1007
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,551
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

1008
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,766
Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1009
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:51,029
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1010
00:58:51,204 --> 00:58:52,671
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.

1011
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,306
Oh, God, no.

1012
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:56,703
How do you know?

1013
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,411
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1014
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,911
She's interested, he's clearly not.

1015
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:05,073
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

1016
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,912
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

1017
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,647
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

1018
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:13,087
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here."

1019
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,657
And look, how fortuitous.

1020
00:59:14,827 --> 00:59:17,489
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

1021
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:19,927
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

1022
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:23,030
Man, you have a gift.

1023
00:59:23,202 --> 00:59:25,295
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

1024
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:29,498
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1025
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,802
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1026
00:59:31,977 --> 00:59:34,810
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

1027
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,572
- Really?
- Bullshit.

1028
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:38,080
Enlighten me.

1029
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,911
Guys invented the spark...

1030
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:43,919
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

1031
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:47,820
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

1032
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:49,585
...was actually just a spark.

1033
00:59:49,762 --> 00:59:52,959
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

1034
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,329
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

1035
00:59:56,502 --> 00:59:57,526
I don't.

1036
00:59:57,703 --> 01:00:01,036
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

1037
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,106
...because secretly you love the drama...

1038
01:00:03,275 --> 01:00:05,743
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

1039
01:00:06,678 --> 01:00:08,043
Maybe.

1040
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:09,805
And let me guess:

1041
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,212
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

1042
01:00:12,384 --> 01:00:14,545
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

1043
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,951
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

1044
01:00:18,123 --> 01:00:20,614
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

1045
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,629
Okay. Yeah.

1046
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:27,459
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

1047
01:00:27,633 --> 01:00:30,466
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

1048
01:00:30,636 --> 01:00:33,833
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

1049
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,031
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

1050
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,032
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

1051
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:42,839
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

1052
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,845
I don't know, I like you.

1053
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,174
You do?

1054
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:52,848
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1055
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:57,051
I just mean... I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1056
01:00:57,228 --> 01:01:00,026
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

1057
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,223
Again with the sensitivity.

1058
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,426
To sensitivity.

1059
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,543
It looks good.

1060
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,148
Yeah.

1061
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:16,841
Yeah.

1062
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:20,449
- He does good work.
- Yeah, he does.

1063
01:01:22,524 --> 01:01:24,253
Very nice.

1064
01:01:28,196 --> 01:01:29,959
Very nice.

1065
01:01:32,834 --> 01:01:35,394
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1066
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:38,538
Javier...

1067
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:41,971
...if I asked you an honest question...

1068
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:44,577
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

1069
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:47,715
- I think so.
- Good, good.

1070
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:52,151
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

1071
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:54,655
Javier?

1072
01:01:54,823 --> 01:01:56,620
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1073
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,351
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

1074
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:01,961
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1075
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,461
Javier...

1076
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:05,994
...have you guys been smoking...

1077
01:02:06,534 --> 01:02:07,933
...or not?

1078
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:13,333
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

1079
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:16,035
Are you sure your guys haven't been...

1080
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,542
...sneaking around here?

1081
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:19,770
And smoking?

1082
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:22,941
And lying to me?

1083
01:02:23,117 --> 01:02:24,379
And smoking?

1084
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:25,609
I'm pretty sure.

1085
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:28,220
I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

1086
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:30,755
Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

1087
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:34,360
To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

1088
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:36,293
That's a lot of prepositions.

1089
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:41,127
I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

1090
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:44,634
I mean, we made promises to each other.

1091
01:02:45,906 --> 01:02:47,965
I mean, we have a contract.

1092
01:02:48,142 --> 01:02:51,134
That's like making promises. Isn't it?

1093
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,076
Maybe I should get back to work.

1094
01:02:57,518 --> 01:02:59,543
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

1095
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,086
That's great, yeah.

1096
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,918
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1097
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:08,384
We're good. Right? You and me.

1098
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:11,561
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.
- Oh, good.

1099
01:03:12,132 --> 01:03:13,565
Okay, that's great.

1100
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:15,759
Yeah, he did great work.

1101
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:22,574
Hey.

1102
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:26,709
Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming. I'm Conor.

1103
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,405
Sign in when you get a second.
Make yourselves at home.

1104
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,780
We got some cookies over here,
some cold beverages. Help yourself.

1105
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:35,513
Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli
of real estate.

1106
01:03:35,689 --> 01:03:39,455
- I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
- I know, she's so great.

1107
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:44,085
Well, I gotta go,
so I guess I'll see you later.

1108
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:45,594
What, you got a class, or?

1109
01:03:45,765 --> 01:03:49,132
Yeah. No. No, just something.

1110
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:51,736
- Stuff I gotta do.
- Okay. Well...

1111
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:54,873
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

1112
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,305
Okay. Bye.

1113
01:03:57,477 --> 01:03:59,377
- See you later.
- All right. Call me.

1114
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:04,773
What?

1115
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:08,577
She's holding out on you, isn't she?

1116
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:12,391
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1117
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:14,651
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1118
01:04:15,194 --> 01:04:18,220
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.

1119
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,768
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

1120
01:04:22,935 --> 01:04:24,368
No, I'm cool.

1121
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:27,199
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

1122
01:04:27,373 --> 01:04:29,238
We used to sleep together all the time.

1123
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:34,305
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

1124
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,972
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

1125
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,983
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

1126
01:04:41,153 --> 01:04:44,350
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

1127
01:04:44,524 --> 01:04:47,015
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

1128
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:50,128
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

1129
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:53,265
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

1130
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,196
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

1131
01:04:56,369 --> 01:05:00,100
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you."

1132
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:03,701
One, two, three.

1133
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:06,208
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

1134
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:09,007
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you."

1135
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:10,705
One, two...

1136
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:13,545
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

1137
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,821
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

1138
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:18,853
All right, well, I can tell you this:

1139
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:22,016
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

1140
01:05:22,193 --> 01:05:25,492
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

1141
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,727
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

1142
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:33,302
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

1143
01:05:36,741 --> 01:05:38,675
<i>If a girl's into you,
she's sleeping with you.</i>

1144
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:42,309
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

1145
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,539
...she's not sleeping with you?

1146
01:05:45,183 --> 01:05:47,048
She doesn't like you.

1147
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,316
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1148
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:53,423
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1149
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:57,426
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

1150
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,928
A girl will never sleep with you...

1151
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:04,159
...if she calls you "cuddly"
or "dependable."

1152
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,493
If she pops a zit in front of you...

1153
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:10,201
...if her name is Amber or Christine...

1154
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:12,577
...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

1155
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:16,339
...or she takes home leftovers
on dates one, two, or three.

1156
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,982
I know it's not scientific...

1157
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,414
...but I'm just saying,
you were warned.

1158
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:44,632
Wait, stop.

1159
01:06:47,912 --> 01:06:48,936
What?

1160
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:51,377
Shit.

1161
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:53,206
What?

1162
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:57,244
I am so into you.

1163
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,281
Seriously, I've never felt like this before.

1164
01:07:00,624 --> 01:07:04,116
I have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you.

1165
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:06,789
Like, all the time.

1166
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:11,733
Why stop?

1167
01:07:14,872 --> 01:07:16,897
Because I don't do stuff like this.

1168
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,939
Stuff like what?

1169
01:07:20,844 --> 01:07:22,744
Like sleep with women
that aren't my wife.

1170
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:27,316
First of all, I am not "women,"
I'm just one.

1171
01:07:27,985 --> 01:07:29,350
And second of all?

1172
01:07:31,055 --> 01:07:32,647
Oh, I didn't have a second of all.

1173
01:07:32,823 --> 01:07:35,621
I was hoping "second of all"
would make me feel better.

1174
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:42,288
Second of all...

1175
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,327
...I can't stop thinking about you either.

1176
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:02,181
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.

1177
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:04,445
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

1178
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:06,680
I don't know. I mean, look at Becca.

1179
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:08,484
You know, my sister's friend.

1180
01:08:08,659 --> 01:08:10,388
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

1181
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:13,860
...and by the end of the meal,
they both knew they had found the one.

1182
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:18,493
You're right. You're totally right.
I mean, it could happen, right?

1183
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,834
Not for me.

1184
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,704
What about texter?

1185
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:25,568
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

1186
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:29,701
I mean, this guy could've had surgery,
leaving him without a voice box...

1187
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:31,346
...breathing through a stoma...

1188
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:34,972
...and I would never know because
I've never actually heard his voice.

1189
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:37,085
Well, I doubt he has a stoma.

1190
01:08:37,253 --> 01:08:40,313
That's not the point. I can't text.

1191
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,651
You know, I'm not charming via text.

1192
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:44,452
Maybe you should just stop texting.

1193
01:08:44,627 --> 01:08:49,587
But it's not just texting, it's e-mail.
It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

1194
01:08:49,766 --> 01:08:50,858
That's regular mail.

1195
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:52,762
Whatever. None of it's working.

1196
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:57,929
I had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work, so I called him at home.

1197
01:08:58,107 --> 01:09:02,544
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

1198
01:09:02,712 --> 01:09:07,649
Then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control.

1199
01:09:07,817 --> 01:09:13,084
And I miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine.

1200
01:09:13,256 --> 01:09:16,020
And that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape...

1201
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:19,855
...and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didn't.

1202
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:23,226
And now you have to go around
checking all these different portals...

1203
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,459
...just to get rejected
by seven different technologies.

1204
01:09:26,636 --> 01:09:28,467
It's exhausting.

1205
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:31,099
What about that MySpace guy?

1206
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:33,834
- Jude. I like him.
- Good.

1207
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:36,911
Yeah, I felt like we connected.

1208
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:38,376
Great.

1209
01:09:38,648 --> 01:09:41,412
<i>What if she wants you to kiss her?</i>

1210
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:45,281
<i>Well, then I guess
I'm just gonna have to kiss her.</i>

1211
01:09:45,454 --> 01:09:47,217
"Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...

1212
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,416
...who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips."

1213
01:09:51,894 --> 01:09:53,794
<i>This babe has plenty of battle scars.</i>

1214
01:09:54,263 --> 01:09:55,287
Hello?

1215
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:57,964
Oh, hey, you're home.

1216
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:00,465
Where am I supposed to be?

1217
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:03,569
Out, maybe? It's Saturday night.

1218
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:07,463
You won't let me go out with guys
who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

1219
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:09,906
Right. Listen, I was just gonna
leave a message.

1220
01:10:10,078 --> 01:10:12,569
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.

1221
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:17,251
Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
Might be kind of awkward.

1222
01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:21,355
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C.
But there'll be a lot of single guys.

1223
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:24,083
So there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward.

1224
01:10:24,259 --> 01:10:26,750
Don't worry, I'll be there.
I'll talk you through it.

1225
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:29,188
Okay, gotta go.

1226
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:32,424
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates.
Maybe I'll see you there.

1227
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:35,035
You're busy. I shouldn't have called.
You called me.

1228
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:37,262
<i>- Yup, good.
- Bye.</i>

1229
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:43,839
<i>How...? How do you work on it?</i>

1230
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,107
<i>Pretend I'm a girl, okay?</i>

1231
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:49,806
<i>I mean...</i>

1232
01:10:50,318 --> 01:10:51,512
<i>... pretend I'm her.</i>

1233
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,081
<i>Amanda.</i>

1234
01:10:57,325 --> 01:10:58,587
He's into me.

1235
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,921
Awesome. I knew it.

1236
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:03,030
- Who's this now?
- Alex.

1237
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:06,463
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

1238
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:09,798
<i>- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.</i>

1239
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:11,996
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson
was Watts.

1240
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:14,403
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?

1241
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,568
I'm Eric Stoltz.

1242
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:21,211
Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones.

1243
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:23,248
Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

1244
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:26,080
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

1245
01:11:26,955 --> 01:11:30,823
I guess. At first. Now men in general,
but that's not the point.

1246
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:32,856
The point is he's into me.

1247
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:36,485
I knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you.

1248
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:40,225
I know. It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.

1249
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,859
Signs. Love signs. You gotta
tell me about the signs. I love signs.

1250
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:47,974
First they were small. At first when I
called, he said, "Good to hear from you."

1251
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,575
- Totally good sign.
- Right?

1252
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:52,371
And then the next time I called
he was with a woman...

1253
01:11:52,546 --> 01:11:55,242
...but he took the call
and we talked for a while.

1254
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,475
- You know it was a woman?
- Called her "babe."

1255
01:11:57,651 --> 01:12:01,587
Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he's...

1256
01:12:01,755 --> 01:12:03,086
And it gets more obvious.

1257
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:07,250
I mean, please. There was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with.

1258
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:08,895
The fix-up was him.

1259
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:10,189
No.

1260
01:12:10,364 --> 01:12:14,300
Yes. He shows up
without this fictitious Bill character.

1261
01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:16,197
The two of us basically have a date.

1262
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:21,307
And then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place.

1263
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,875
He so likes you.

1264
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:27,608
I'm so happy for you.

1265
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:30,716
Let's look up places
for your destination wedding.

1266
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,815
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

1267
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:39,152
I have really always wanted to go there.

1268
01:12:42,262 --> 01:12:43,889
Oh, he's cute.

1269
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:46,498
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

1270
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:51,601
Oh. "All I have is my guitar, these chords,
and the truth."

1271
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:52,966
Bon Jovi.

1272
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,540
- That's hot.
- Yeah. I like him.

1273
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:59,770
I mean, he probably hasn't called yet
because we just had coffee last night.

1274
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:02,111
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

1275
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:05,513
I mean, we actually video
iChatted while holding coffee.

1276
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:07,346
But that's the same thing, right?

1277
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,647
- Right, right.
- Just call your voicemail.

1278
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:13,690
Yeah, but he had a gig last night
and he probably didn't get home till late.

1279
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,828
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.

1280
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:17,758
- Just call.
- Oh, honey, no, on speaker.

1281
01:13:18,364 --> 01:13:20,662
I don't think so.
I'm sure he hasn't called.

1282
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,357
- Just call him.
- Okay.

1283
01:13:28,107 --> 01:13:31,565
<i>You have two new messages.
- Oh.</i>

1284
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:35,381
<i>Mary</i>

1285
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:39,416
<i>Whoa, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary</i>

1286
01:13:39,952 --> 01:13:42,921
<i>Oh, my Mary</i>

1287
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:45,122
I just got hard.

1288
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:46,781
<i>Hey, Mary, it's Jude.</i>

1289
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:50,895
<i>I was just calling to tell you again
how special it was to meet you.</i>

1290
01:13:51,064 --> 01:13:54,625
<i>So call me back. Bye-bye.</i>

1291
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:57,796
Amazing.

1292
01:13:58,304 --> 01:14:00,431
This is good, this is good.
- This is...

1293
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:01,834
See, he called.

1294
01:14:02,008 --> 01:14:03,703
<i>Jenny</i>

1295
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:07,812
<i>Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny</i>

1296
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,177
<i>Hey, Jenny, it's Jude.
I was just calling to...</i>

1297
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:15,377
<i>Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?</i>

1298
01:14:15,588 --> 01:14:18,580
<i>All messages erased.</i>

1299
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:31,060
That one.

1300
01:14:31,237 --> 01:14:32,329
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1301
01:14:33,873 --> 01:14:35,932
No. It's a laminate.

1302
01:14:36,943 --> 01:14:39,376
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.

1303
01:14:39,544 --> 01:14:43,036
It looks exactly like it. But it is
like one one-hundredth of the cost.

1304
01:14:43,215 --> 01:14:44,409
Oh.

1305
01:14:45,984 --> 01:14:47,747
I still wanna go with the real wood.

1306
01:14:48,553 --> 01:14:50,851
What? You can't even tell the difference.

1307
01:14:51,022 --> 01:14:52,751
It's not the point.

1308
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,123
Well, what is the point?

1309
01:14:55,293 --> 01:14:56,988
I just...

1310
01:14:57,462 --> 01:15:00,158
I don't like the way
it's pretending to be wood.

1311
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:02,926
If you're not wood,
don't try and look like wood.

1312
01:15:03,702 --> 01:15:05,761
I don't think that it's pretending.

1313
01:15:06,972 --> 01:15:08,633
This is a lie, Ben.

1314
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:12,436
Just be up front
and tell people what you really are.

1315
01:15:14,179 --> 01:15:16,374
Okay, you're right. You're right.

1316
01:15:16,548 --> 01:15:18,175
I'm sorry.

1317
01:15:21,052 --> 01:15:24,613
It's okay. Maybe we should just go
look at the grills and we'll come back.

1318
01:15:25,557 --> 01:15:26,581
Okay.

1319
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:33,097
I slept with someone.

1320
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,801
- I said...
- I heard you.

1321
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:51,377
You tell me this in Home Depot
because you know I hate a public scene.

1322
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:54,246
No, that is not why I'm telling...

1323
01:15:54,753 --> 01:15:56,345
I knew it.

1324
01:15:57,255 --> 01:15:58,279
I knew it.

1325
01:15:58,456 --> 01:16:00,356
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.

1326
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,295
It is you that's been smoking too,
isn't it?

1327
01:16:05,897 --> 01:16:08,365
Wha...? Wait, what does that
even matter?

1328
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:10,228
Have you...?!

1329
01:16:11,603 --> 01:16:13,126
Have you been smoking?

1330
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:14,635
No. No, I haven't.

1331
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,209
I talked to Neil. I told him.

1332
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,177
He said I could stay
at his boat for a while.

1333
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:26,646
Excuse me?

1334
01:16:27,785 --> 01:16:29,878
Now you're moving out?

1335
01:16:30,054 --> 01:16:31,954
- You're, like, leaving me?
- No.

1336
01:16:32,122 --> 01:16:35,319
No, I just assumed
that you wouldn't want me to...

1337
01:16:36,393 --> 01:16:40,056
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

1338
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:44,190
Don't you wanna find some way...

1339
01:16:44,368 --> 01:16:46,996
...for us to work through this?

1340
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:51,406
I assumed that when I told you,
you would want me...

1341
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:53,333
...out.

1342
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,809
Is that what you want?

1343
01:17:11,095 --> 01:17:12,357
No.

1344
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,163
Okay.

1345
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:18,034
Okay.

1346
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:43,582
You're doing a great job.

1347
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,467
Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget. Hi!

1348
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,071
Oh, my goodness.

1349
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:04,812
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

1350
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:18,383
Seriously, Devon, I really did feel
just a moment, a splash, of hesitation.

1351
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,893
No, there wasn't.
There wasn't any hesitation at all.

1352
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:23,123
You just did it again. That was a pause.

1353
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,563
I did not pause.

1354
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:33,873
You must be Beth.

1355
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:38,371
Yeah. Yeah.

1356
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,846
Heard a lot about you from Paige.

1357
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:45,285
Actually been lobbying
to sit next to her single sister for weeks.

1358
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:47,755
Oh, yeah?

1359
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,392
So you must be:

1360
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,187
"Dan."

1361
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,162
Sort of.

1362
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:58,396
- Sort of?
- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan.

1363
01:18:58,568 --> 01:19:00,263
- A what?
- A Wiccan.

1364
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,027
Wiccan?

1365
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,763
- Male witch.
- Right.

1366
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,500
So I also have a magical name.

1367
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:09,174
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.

1368
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:12,712
But I didn't know if that would fit
on the card. Love that.

1369
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:15,510
I'm guessing that I'm gonna
hear a whole lot about you.

1370
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:18,176
Nature-based
pre-Christian paganism, yeah.

1371
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,344
Yeah. That's fantastic.

1372
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:21,955
Well, where to begin?

1373
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:25,116
Well, first off, it's not just a bunch
of nude farming. Dad.

1374
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,318
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.

1375
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,793
Obviously not a coincidence.

1376
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,762
They didn't have the machinery
to move those rocks. They're huge.

1377
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,922
- Yeah, they're heavy.
- Of course.

1378
01:20:03,263 --> 01:20:06,255
- I'm Nathan. And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.

1379
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:08,926
- Gigi. Hi.
- Hey.

1380
01:20:09,936 --> 01:20:13,337
So how do you guys know Alex?

1381
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:18,237
We don't. Our friend Mary heard
about this from some guy named Conor.

1382
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:23,475
And how do you know Alex?

1383
01:20:25,352 --> 01:20:26,979
I hope...

1384
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,812
I'm pretty sure that something's
about to happen between us.

1385
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:32,515
Ooh.
- Oh.

1386
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:36,458
So are you here as, like, a guest,
or, like, his date?

1387
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:40,327
Oh, I hate that.
When you don't know if you're a date.

1388
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,765
You don't know if you should bring
a friend, or are you co-hosting...

1389
01:20:43,937 --> 01:20:46,633
...or should you stay to the end
to have some alone time?

1390
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:49,275
He didn't say.
I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

1391
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,973
- I mean, there have been signs.
- Cool.

1392
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,498
So where's Neil?

1393
01:21:19,672 --> 01:21:20,730
We broke up.

1394
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:23,136
- No way.
- Yeah.

1395
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:25,803
You guys were together,
what, like 10 years?

1396
01:21:25,978 --> 01:21:27,775
Seven. But still, it's a long time.

1397
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:29,073
Yeah.

1398
01:21:29,648 --> 01:21:32,549
It's too bad cousins can't marry,
because then we could maybe...

1399
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:34,686
Oh, Dominic.

1400
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,079
- Gross.
- No.

1401
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:40,819
Ken, are you okay? What happened?

1402
01:21:43,162 --> 01:21:44,186
Oh, my God.

1403
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:46,627
Ken, are you all right?
- Just clutched his chest.

1404
01:21:46,799 --> 01:21:48,767
He was standing there
and all of a sudden...

1405
01:21:49,235 --> 01:21:50,964
Ken, just try to breathe.
- Call 911.

1406
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:52,262
Dad. Excuse me.

1407
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:54,929
Daddy, what is it? What happened?
What happened?

1408
01:21:55,107 --> 01:21:57,041
- Guys, come here!
- What happened?

1409
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:58,642
Daddy, lay down, okay?

1410
01:21:58,811 --> 01:22:00,142
Did he fall?
- You'll be fine.

1411
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:03,179
You guys, did anybody
see what happened?

1412
01:22:03,349 --> 01:22:05,874
Over there. Just go get it.
- Okay.

1413
01:22:08,287 --> 01:22:10,551
Hey, hey. I had no idea
it'd be such a madhouse.

1414
01:22:10,723 --> 01:22:11,985
Hey. Great party.

1415
01:22:12,157 --> 01:22:14,557
Thanks. Did any guys hit on you?
A lot of them here.

1416
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:17,321
You need me to evaluate
any level of interest?

1417
01:22:17,496 --> 01:22:20,761
They were gay. Even I know
their level of interest was probably low.

1418
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:21,957
Hey, Skilo!

1419
01:22:22,134 --> 01:22:25,331
It's too bad Bill couldn't make it.
I know you guys would hit it off.

1420
01:22:25,504 --> 01:22:26,902
Okay, right. "Bill."

1421
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:29,063
Right.

1422
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:37,647
Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run,
but the food needs some refreshing.

1423
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:41,078
- Would you mind helping and refilling...?
- Like co-hosting?

1424
01:22:42,453 --> 01:22:44,580
Okay, yeah.

1425
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:45,780
Sure.

1426
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:48,289
Just refilling the chips.
They're on the fridge.

1427
01:22:48,459 --> 01:22:49,551
Thanks.

1428
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:56,231
Hey, sweetie, get me a beer?
- I'll get you another.

1429
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,869
- Hi, guys.
- Nice.

1430
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:01,028
Hey, Linda.

1431
01:23:16,754 --> 01:23:19,052
- Really great party.
- Oh, thanks.

1432
01:23:19,857 --> 01:23:23,588
You know, when Alex said he wanted
to throw a party, I was like, "Let's do it!"

1433
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:26,559
- Thanks for having us.
- No problem, any time.

1434
01:23:27,398 --> 01:23:28,797
Can I help you find something?

1435
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,026
Oh, no, it's okay. I got it.

1436
01:23:31,202 --> 01:23:32,635
Thanks for mixing that up.

1437
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:34,529
What?

1438
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:38,369
Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.

1439
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:41,407
It could use a little more dill.

1440
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:43,308
I'm on it, though, don't worry.

1441
01:23:47,485 --> 01:23:49,214
Come on, my boy. Take it home.

1442
01:23:49,387 --> 01:23:51,218
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

1443
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:53,016
Fifteen seconds.
- Let's go.

1444
01:23:53,191 --> 01:23:55,489
Oh, a pass.
- You work too hard.

1445
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,993
Well, I think I've rounded up
the last of the beer bottles.

1446
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,422
- Oh, what game are we playing?
- Oh, sorry, Nash.

1447
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,830
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1448
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:09,632
Nash, you piece of shit. Come on.
- Maybe I should just...

1449
01:24:09,806 --> 01:24:11,535
- It's past 3, so...
- Okay, swat it.

1450
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,141
Watch this. Ready?

1451
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,868
- And...
- Oh, no, no, no!

1452
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:18,242
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

1453
01:24:18,415 --> 01:24:20,349
Oh, you are... You're sensational.

1454
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:21,575
- Yeah, I know.
- Jesus.

1455
01:24:22,285 --> 01:24:23,843
I don't know why I bother.

1456
01:24:24,021 --> 01:24:25,989
- Did you say it's past 3?
- Yeah.

1457
01:24:26,156 --> 01:24:29,455
- Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game.
- All right.

1458
01:24:29,626 --> 01:24:31,651
Bye.
- Bye.

1459
01:24:54,651 --> 01:24:57,745
Hey, thanks for staying
and helping me clean up.

1460
01:24:58,722 --> 01:25:00,883
I really gotta go to bed, though.

1461
01:25:01,058 --> 01:25:02,548
Is that an invitation?

1462
01:25:03,427 --> 01:25:04,451
What?

1463
01:25:05,862 --> 01:25:08,023
Oh, God, that was cheesy.

1464
01:25:08,465 --> 01:25:10,956
Oh, I'm not good at this.

1465
01:25:11,401 --> 01:25:12,527
What?

1466
01:25:21,578 --> 01:25:22,840
Hey.

1467
01:25:23,246 --> 01:25:25,441
Oh, yes. I knew it.

1468
01:25:25,615 --> 01:25:28,675
The best relationships
grow out of friendships.

1469
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:30,911
Wait, wait, wait. Gigi.

1470
01:25:31,555 --> 01:25:33,750
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:35,220
What?

1472
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:37,222
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1473
01:25:37,393 --> 01:25:41,295
Well, I'd say if we're not
at relationship station-ship...

1474
01:25:41,464 --> 01:25:42,931
...we're at least on the track.

1475
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,325
And why exactly would you think that?

1476
01:25:47,503 --> 01:25:49,266
Because of the signs.

1477
01:25:49,839 --> 01:25:51,204
Really, like what?

1478
01:25:51,373 --> 01:25:54,604
Like, it was good to hear from me...

1479
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:58,144
...and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl...

1480
01:25:58,314 --> 01:26:01,010
...and I felt something.

1481
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,484
Oh, man.

1482
01:26:03,652 --> 01:26:04,914
What are you talking about?

1483
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:08,386
Gigi, what have I been saying
since I met you?

1484
01:26:08,557 --> 01:26:12,220
If a guy wants to date you, he will make
it happen, okay? He will ask you out.

1485
01:26:12,394 --> 01:26:13,588
Did I ask you out?

1486
01:26:14,864 --> 01:26:15,956
No.

1487
01:26:16,132 --> 01:26:18,657
Why would you do this?

1488
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:20,936
Oh, shit.

1489
01:26:21,103 --> 01:26:23,799
Why do women do this?
Build up this stuff in their minds...

1490
01:26:23,973 --> 01:26:27,841
...take each little thing a guy does,
and then twist it into something else?

1491
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,705
It's insane.

1492
01:26:40,089 --> 01:26:43,149
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1493
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:46,489
Excuse me?

1494
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:48,630
What is that supposed to mean?

1495
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,696
I may dissect each little thing...

1496
01:26:53,869 --> 01:26:56,929
...and put myself out there too much...

1497
01:26:57,106 --> 01:26:59,438
...but at least that means I still care.

1498
01:26:59,608 --> 01:27:05,478
Oh, you think you've won
because women are expendable to you?

1499
01:27:05,648 --> 01:27:09,981
You may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way...

1500
01:27:10,151 --> 01:27:12,847
...but you don't fall in love
that way either.

1501
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,750
You have not won.

1502
01:27:14,923 --> 01:27:17,084
You're alone, Alex.

1503
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:26,197
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

1504
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:30,861
...but I know I'm a lot closer
to finding someone than you are.

1505
01:27:38,913 --> 01:27:41,040
Do you want anything else?

1506
01:27:41,216 --> 01:27:44,674
Yeah, less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food.

1507
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:49,448
Well, that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1508
01:27:49,857 --> 01:27:53,349
Well, maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links.

1509
01:27:53,528 --> 01:27:56,656
People who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised...

1510
01:27:56,831 --> 01:28:00,289
...to have animal fat that's been stuffed
into a synthetic casing.

1511
01:28:11,012 --> 01:28:14,675
Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen, okay?

1512
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:17,682
And a little plate of cold cuts,
if there are any left.

1513
01:28:17,852 --> 01:28:21,379
Hey, would you guys please just turn
that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

1514
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:23,547
You think he wants
to hang on to this vinyl?

1515
01:28:23,725 --> 01:28:25,750
My collection could use a lot of these.

1516
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:28,259
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

1517
01:28:31,532 --> 01:28:34,023
Well, we're totally out of toilet paper...

1518
01:28:34,202 --> 01:28:38,832
...and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

1519
01:28:39,007 --> 01:28:43,670
And our new brother would like to co-opt
Dad's property before he's even dead.

1520
01:28:43,844 --> 01:28:46,972
Laura, also your husband would
really like another beer...

1521
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:50,275
...to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network.

1522
01:28:52,252 --> 01:28:53,844
Are you okay?

1523
01:28:55,322 --> 01:28:58,018
Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine.

1524
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:01,284
Do you know who it is?
- No.

1525
01:29:02,596 --> 01:29:04,461
Doesn't matter.

1526
01:29:05,832 --> 01:29:07,299
So are you gonna leave him?

1527
01:29:08,368 --> 01:29:11,428
Gigi, he's my husband.

1528
01:29:11,605 --> 01:29:14,768
He's not some guy
who didn't call me back.

1529
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:16,875
He did admit it to me.

1530
01:29:17,244 --> 01:29:20,736
He didn't wait to get caught,
which takes courage, you know?

1531
01:29:21,682 --> 01:29:24,048
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

1532
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:25,479
I didn't mean it.

1533
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,086
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

1534
01:29:28,455 --> 01:29:30,446
Oh, it's okay.

1535
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:35,825
It's my fault, you know.

1536
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:37,388
What?

1537
01:29:37,564 --> 01:29:43,833
Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole...

1538
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:46,564
...mess. You know?

1539
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,504
I forced him into getting married.

1540
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:53,106
- You know, he wasn't ready.
- Janine, this isn't your fault.

1541
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,306
No, it is. It is, I've changed.

1542
01:29:57,084 --> 01:29:58,847
I was...

1543
01:29:59,886 --> 01:30:02,013
...fun, you know?

1544
01:30:02,422 --> 01:30:04,219
I was fun when we first met.

1545
01:30:04,391 --> 01:30:05,517
You're still fun.

1546
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:15,699
We don't have sex anymore.

1547
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,271
Lots of couples go through lulls.

1548
01:30:23,442 --> 01:30:24,932
No, I mean...

1549
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,247
...we never have sex.

1550
01:30:38,157 --> 01:30:41,183
I mean, realistically,
what do I expect him to do, you know?

1551
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,658
I don't think that's really...

1552
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:48,059
God, this tile is too small.

1553
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,168
I have to tell Javier.

1554
01:30:50,636 --> 01:30:53,799
- What?
- This tile is too small.

1555
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:57,940
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,
if anyone asks.

1556
01:31:06,318 --> 01:31:09,549
Well, my first husband was unimpressive.

1557
01:31:09,722 --> 01:31:12,520
I found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary...

1558
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:14,886
...when I came home early
from the Maldives.

1559
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,961
It was just so unoriginal.

1560
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,496
Made me feel sorry for him.

1561
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:24,329
My second husband
was a pinch more creative.

1562
01:31:24,503 --> 01:31:26,300
Cheated on me with my sister...

1563
01:31:26,472 --> 01:31:31,535
...but made me believe that I was insane
for being suspicious.

1564
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:35,168
So at least some mind games,
some intrigue.

1565
01:31:35,347 --> 01:31:38,976
But my last husband, he was a gem.

1566
01:31:39,151 --> 01:31:42,052
He was a veritable master
at covering his tracks.

1567
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:47,158
I mean, I pored over his phone records,
I intercepted his credit-card bills...

1568
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,418
...I had him followed
on numerous occasions...

1569
01:31:49,594 --> 01:31:52,927
...and never found
a single shred of evidence.

1570
01:31:53,097 --> 01:31:55,497
It wasn't until he died...

1571
01:31:55,667 --> 01:32:00,866
...that I found out about the property
he owned with his Austrian mistress.

1572
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:05,738
But the real master, I have to say, is me.

1573
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:11,576
Three husbands, countless boyfriends,
I haven't been caught yet.

1574
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:14,043
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1575
01:32:16,287 --> 01:32:19,279
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't...
- Shh.

1576
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,959
It's over there.

1577
01:32:30,568 --> 01:32:32,229
Oh, my God.

1578
01:32:32,403 --> 01:32:34,166
He liked the demo. I can't believe it.

1579
01:32:34,339 --> 01:32:35,397
It's unbelievable.

1580
01:32:35,573 --> 01:32:38,269
Did you hear when he said
that it was hauntingly beautiful?

1581
01:32:38,443 --> 01:32:40,434
Yeah, I was there. I was...

1582
01:32:40,612 --> 01:32:42,307
I was there, baby.

1583
01:32:42,847 --> 01:32:44,576
Thank you.

1584
01:33:16,648 --> 01:33:20,709
Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over
some offering statements. You gotta...

1585
01:33:21,785 --> 01:33:23,753
You gotta come back later.

1586
01:33:24,488 --> 01:33:26,547
It's not Dana.

1587
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:30,684
Is that your...?

1588
01:33:31,695 --> 01:33:32,957
- Is that your...?
- Shh.

1589
01:33:33,564 --> 01:33:35,031
Can you get in the closet?

1590
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:38,391
- Get in the closet.
- What?

1591
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:41,037
Just go in the closet for a second.
Just for a second.

1592
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:42,228
Ben?

1593
01:33:45,075 --> 01:33:48,238
I keep telling Dana
to get that damn lock fixed.

1594
01:33:48,845 --> 01:33:51,780
Why do you even bother locking it?
- What?

1595
01:33:51,949 --> 01:33:54,349
Why do you bother locking it?

1596
01:33:55,352 --> 01:33:58,446
Oh, you know I can't get any work done
if I don't.

1597
01:34:06,063 --> 01:34:08,588
- Hey.
- Hi.

1598
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,667
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

1599
01:34:24,481 --> 01:34:25,505
What are you doing?

1600
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:28,175
Sit down.

1601
01:34:28,452 --> 01:34:29,976
Okay.

1602
01:34:42,065 --> 01:34:43,692
Hon?

1603
01:34:48,572 --> 01:34:49,630
What are you doing?

1604
01:34:50,107 --> 01:34:52,268
I don't know. I just thought...

1605
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:54,069
...maybe we could...

1606
01:34:55,978 --> 01:34:57,172
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

1607
01:34:57,346 --> 01:34:59,337
Maybe if you just go over there.

1608
01:34:59,515 --> 01:35:01,779
Just trying to...

1609
01:35:02,585 --> 01:35:04,416
...you know, re-light the fire.

1610
01:35:04,587 --> 01:35:06,748
Oh, honey.

1611
01:35:06,922 --> 01:35:11,120
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.

1612
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:14,722
Look...

1613
01:35:16,265 --> 01:35:18,529
...I'm really trying here.

1614
01:35:20,803 --> 01:35:23,931
Do you wanna save our marriage?

1615
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:30,778
Of course.

1616
01:35:31,414 --> 01:35:32,938
Me too.

1617
01:35:57,139 --> 01:36:00,905
Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in
with the bussers when you can.

1618
01:36:01,077 --> 01:36:03,045
Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.

1619
01:36:03,713 --> 01:36:06,682
Hey, I been working here 18 months,
8 through 10.

1620
01:36:07,917 --> 01:36:09,885
Minor oversight.

1621
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,421
Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then.

1622
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:18,048
Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago.

1623
01:36:19,795 --> 01:36:21,285
Yeah, he quit.

1624
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:25,566
Is there any reason
we're even having this meeting?

1625
01:36:25,735 --> 01:36:26,895
Not really.

1626
01:36:27,069 --> 01:36:29,036
- No, not for me.
- Great. Good. Great.

1627
01:36:29,204 --> 01:36:31,104
Meeting adjourned.

1628
01:36:31,272 --> 01:36:33,035
Back to work.

1629
01:36:37,612 --> 01:36:39,876
Hey, Kelli Ann.

1630
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:43,677
Did I get any calls?

1631
01:36:43,852 --> 01:36:49,188
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no.
Not a lot of phone traffic.

1632
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:56,158
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1633
01:36:56,831 --> 01:36:57,923
What's her name?

1634
01:36:59,801 --> 01:37:01,132
Who?

1635
01:37:01,302 --> 01:37:02,701
The girl, Alex.

1636
01:37:03,338 --> 01:37:05,499
There's no girl.

1637
01:37:05,673 --> 01:37:07,106
You can't hide it, man.

1638
01:37:07,275 --> 01:37:10,676
I know strung out
and you are strung out.

1639
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:15,140
Okay, please.

1640
01:37:15,683 --> 01:37:17,275
This is amazing.

1641
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:19,582
You can't focus, right?

1642
01:37:19,754 --> 01:37:24,020
Jumping every time your phone rings,
checking your e-mail 100 times a day...

1643
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:25,955
...wishing you could write songs.

1644
01:37:26,127 --> 01:37:30,791
No, feeling the need to bring up her name
in random conversations.

1645
01:37:31,466 --> 01:37:35,266
It's always the same
and it has happened to you, my friend.

1646
01:37:39,073 --> 01:37:40,597
Shit.

1647
01:37:43,211 --> 01:37:44,576
Welcome to my world, asshole.

1648
01:37:46,748 --> 01:37:48,511
Let me get the door.

1649
01:37:52,153 --> 01:37:55,020
Sure I can't interest you
in a little beef and broccoli?

1650
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:57,055
I gotta finish this stuff.

1651
01:37:57,225 --> 01:37:58,658
Okay.

1652
01:38:00,161 --> 01:38:03,061
- Yeah. So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

1653
01:38:04,031 --> 01:38:05,692
I love you.

1654
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,031
I love you too.

1655
01:38:12,806 --> 01:38:15,104
- Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1656
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,177
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.

1657
01:38:25,352 --> 01:38:28,116
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?

1658
01:38:28,288 --> 01:38:30,483
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!

1659
01:38:30,657 --> 01:38:33,057
You will never touch me again.

1660
01:38:38,232 --> 01:38:40,666
Dino, thanks again for letting me
pay over the phone.

1661
01:38:40,834 --> 01:38:44,895
I assure you this late-payment thing
will never happen again.

1662
01:38:45,072 --> 01:38:47,632
Yep, just trying to trim
some of the drama out of my life.

1663
01:38:48,976 --> 01:38:50,068
Oh, that's my other line.

1664
01:38:50,244 --> 01:38:51,438
Okay, bye.

1665
01:38:51,612 --> 01:38:53,637
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Gigi?</i>

1666
01:38:53,814 --> 01:38:55,213
<i>This is Bill.</i>

1667
01:38:55,382 --> 01:38:57,373
<i>- Bill?
- Alex's friend.</i>

1668
01:38:57,551 --> 01:39:01,647
<i>We were supposed to meet up
but Alex told me the wrong day.</i>

1669
01:39:02,356 --> 01:39:04,347
Bill, so you do exist.

1670
01:39:04,524 --> 01:39:05,855
<i>I do.</i>

1671
01:39:06,026 --> 01:39:10,087
<i>And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime
if you're still game.</i>

1672
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:12,460
Yes.

1673
01:39:12,633 --> 01:39:14,760
Sure, why not?

1674
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:23,837
Hey.

1675
01:39:24,011 --> 01:39:26,104
Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1676
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,680
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

1677
01:39:29,116 --> 01:39:30,913
See, why did you
just call me "sweetie"?

1678
01:39:31,084 --> 01:39:34,178
- We always call each other that.
- Why?

1679
01:39:34,354 --> 01:39:37,345
All right, look,
I wanna say something, okay?

1680
01:39:37,523 --> 01:39:39,923
We call each other "sweetie"
all the time.

1681
01:39:40,092 --> 01:39:42,856
And we fall asleep on the phone
after talking for hours.

1682
01:39:43,029 --> 01:39:46,396
I washed your hair for you after
you had shoulder surgery and everything.

1683
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:47,930
And it's like we're together.

1684
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,227
- I know that I've been...
- No, hold on a second.

1685
01:39:50,403 --> 01:39:52,234
Let me finish.

1686
01:39:52,405 --> 01:39:54,236
I think maybe this is my fault...

1687
01:39:54,407 --> 01:39:58,138
...because maybe I wasn't clear
about exactly what I want.

1688
01:39:58,311 --> 01:40:00,939
So let me... Let me be clear.

1689
01:40:01,113 --> 01:40:03,013
I love hanging out.

1690
01:40:03,349 --> 01:40:07,183
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just... I want both.

1691
01:40:07,353 --> 01:40:10,117
I don't know what happened
or why we stopped. I don't care.

1692
01:40:10,289 --> 01:40:11,722
Okay.

1693
01:40:12,992 --> 01:40:14,550
- What?
- Okay.

1694
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:17,924
No, I'm talking about really doing this.
Like a full-on relationship.

1695
01:40:18,097 --> 01:40:19,587
Right.

1696
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:21,096
With me.

1697
01:40:21,267 --> 01:40:22,666
Yeah.

1698
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:26,035
A bunch of gay people
put you up to this?

1699
01:40:26,205 --> 01:40:28,002
Stop talking.

1700
01:40:46,993 --> 01:40:50,190
Stay home. It's an end-around.
- No, no, it's not. He's still got it.

1701
01:40:50,363 --> 01:40:51,796
He's still got it.

1702
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:54,558
Shit.
- Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.

1703
01:40:54,734 --> 01:40:58,534
Argh!
- That is so embarrassing.

1704
01:40:58,904 --> 01:40:59,928
What?

1705
01:41:01,207 --> 01:41:03,732
Did any of you guys have a chance
to get to the store?

1706
01:41:04,276 --> 01:41:06,471
Oh, yeah, no.
We're good, we got takeout.

1707
01:41:07,046 --> 01:41:09,240
No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f...

1708
01:41:09,414 --> 01:41:12,383
All right, here we go.
- Come on, defense, wake up.

1709
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,749
You have to be kidding me.

1710
01:41:30,035 --> 01:41:33,368
I just got a little bit more of this
I gotta finish.

1711
01:41:33,538 --> 01:41:35,699
There's some laundry
I'm gonna put away...

1712
01:41:35,874 --> 01:41:38,604
...then I had another load of clothes
in the dryer.

1713
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:42,341
I did get some of the food your dad likes,
but some healthy stuff too.

1714
01:41:42,514 --> 01:41:44,345
Just, you know.

1715
01:41:47,318 --> 01:41:49,411
It's gonna be okay.

1716
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,316
It'll be okay.

1717
01:43:02,392 --> 01:43:04,519
Bend your knee a little bit more.
There you go.

1718
01:43:04,695 --> 01:43:06,822
Inhale, reverse warrior, look up.

1719
01:43:06,997 --> 01:43:08,089
Exhale.

1720
01:43:19,743 --> 01:43:22,610
<i>Hi, you've reached Ben's cell phone.
Please leave...</i>

1721
01:43:52,276 --> 01:43:55,541
You lying sack of shit!

1722
01:44:00,884 --> 01:44:02,545
Lying!

1723
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:03,743
Sack!

1724
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:05,513
Shit!

1725
01:44:44,794 --> 01:44:46,557
Okay.

1726
01:44:56,973 --> 01:44:58,838
<i>or call my cell, or try me at work...</i>

1727
01:44:59,008 --> 01:45:02,341
<i>... but definitely leave a message
here first. Thanks.</i>

1728
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:05,810
Hey, Gigi, it's Alex.

1729
01:45:06,382 --> 01:45:08,179
How's it going?

1730
01:45:08,351 --> 01:45:10,251
Just wondering how you're doing.

1731
01:45:10,419 --> 01:45:14,253
I haven't talked to you in a little while...

1732
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:16,584
...and was just wondering
how you're doing.

1733
01:45:16,759 --> 01:45:20,388
So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you.

1734
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:23,389
Obviously.

1735
01:45:23,966 --> 01:45:25,866
But you're out, I guess.

1736
01:45:26,035 --> 01:45:29,732
So just call me sometime.

1737
01:45:29,905 --> 01:45:31,065
Or tonight.

1738
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,834
I'm around, I'll be...
Well, I'm in and around.

1739
01:45:34,543 --> 01:45:37,239
So that's enough for now.

1740
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:40,476
It's Alex.

1741
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:42,242
Okay.

1742
01:45:45,888 --> 01:45:46,912
Dude.

1743
01:45:48,024 --> 01:45:49,616
I know.

1744
01:46:08,576 --> 01:46:09,600
Hey.

1745
01:46:09,778 --> 01:46:11,507
Hey.

1746
01:46:13,515 --> 01:46:14,777
Welcome aboard.

1747
01:46:14,949 --> 01:46:16,109
Might I come aboard?

1748
01:46:16,284 --> 01:46:18,718
Yeah. You remember the boat.

1749
01:46:18,887 --> 01:46:21,412
Well, you know, I thought I did.

1750
01:46:21,589 --> 01:46:24,023
- Or, you know, little...
- But it's been a while.

1751
01:46:24,192 --> 01:46:28,458
You know that dock? Over there,
there's a boat that looks just like yours.

1752
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:30,063
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.

1753
01:46:30,231 --> 01:46:32,597
- No, that's not my boat.
- It's definitely not.

1754
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:36,203
But there's a very nice gentleman...

1755
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:37,633
...living on the boat...

1756
01:46:37,806 --> 01:46:40,934
...who invited me in
for a white-wine spritzer.

1757
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:42,235
Oh, good.

1758
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,403
Wasn't expecting visitors.

1759
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:50,574
That's all right. I just wanted
to just come by and say thanks...

1760
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,686
...for helping yesterday.

1761
01:46:52,854 --> 01:46:56,881
Beth, you know, I'm the same person.

1762
01:46:57,058 --> 01:46:59,492
I would do anything for you.

1763
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:02,095
I just can't give you...

1764
01:47:02,263 --> 01:47:03,992
I just can't give you what you want.

1765
01:47:04,165 --> 01:47:05,962
You're what I want.

1766
01:47:06,134 --> 01:47:09,262
Our life together is what I want.

1767
01:47:09,437 --> 01:47:10,529
I miss it.

1768
01:47:10,705 --> 01:47:12,002
I miss you.

1769
01:47:12,173 --> 01:47:14,698
You see those guys my sisters
are married to...

1770
01:47:14,876 --> 01:47:17,436
You're more of a husband to me,
not being married...

1771
01:47:17,612 --> 01:47:21,070
...than those real husbands
are ever gonna be, and...

1772
01:47:21,249 --> 01:47:25,344
It's enough. It's really enough for me.

1773
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:30,188
And you would be willing...

1774
01:47:30,357 --> 01:47:34,851
...to take the whole marriage thing
off the table completely?

1775
01:47:35,028 --> 01:47:38,987
If you promise to commit to me
and to love me, and...

1776
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:41,293
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.

1777
01:47:41,969 --> 01:47:43,561
Okay. All right.

1778
01:47:43,737 --> 01:47:47,264
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.

1779
01:47:47,441 --> 01:47:48,999
Okay.

1780
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:54,078
You have to snake the drain
when my hair gets clogged.

1781
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:56,216
You know that happens. Okay?

1782
01:47:56,383 --> 01:47:57,816
Okay. Yeah.

1783
01:47:57,985 --> 01:47:59,714
And also...

1784
01:48:01,889 --> 01:48:05,347
...you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins
in bed. You gotta give me that.

1785
01:48:05,526 --> 01:48:07,517
- Okay, fine. All right.
- Okay?

1786
01:48:08,796 --> 01:48:10,491
And...

1787
01:48:11,064 --> 01:48:12,395
- Yeah.
- And?

1788
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:15,034
- That's it.
- Okay.

1789
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:20,338
Do I get to come home now?

1790
01:48:21,308 --> 01:48:23,367
I guess you can.

1791
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:28,742
But these cannot come.

1792
01:48:29,249 --> 01:48:30,841
- What, my pants...?
- That's correct.

1793
01:48:31,018 --> 01:48:33,213
- Can't come home? Why?
- No.

1794
01:48:33,387 --> 01:48:36,652
You just won a really big battle,
my friend. Come on.

1795
01:48:38,459 --> 01:48:43,954
So we're not gonna get married,
but I have to get rid of my pants.

1796
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:46,964
Mm-hm. And we both win.

1797
01:48:47,334 --> 01:48:50,269
All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

1798
01:48:50,537 --> 01:48:52,471
You're getting
a lot of bids on this place?

1799
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:55,870
Yeah. I know it's crazy,
but it's a neighborhood in transition.

1800
01:48:56,043 --> 01:48:59,034
Is that like young, hip, gay couples
or something like that?

1801
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:03,308
Yeah. Hip gay people,
young couples, young families.

1802
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:07,752
Wow.

1803
01:49:08,421 --> 01:49:11,322
God, this reminds me of where I grew up.

1804
01:49:11,724 --> 01:49:13,988
I bet it's got one of the...

1805
01:49:14,961 --> 01:49:17,020
Wait a minute.

1806
01:49:17,497 --> 01:49:19,761
Oh, yeah.

1807
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:23,226
Yeah, that's it.

1808
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:26,335
We used to have the exact same one...

1809
01:49:26,506 --> 01:49:29,839
...except my mom used it as a desk.

1810
01:49:31,911 --> 01:49:33,879
So...

1811
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:37,110
...when do all the fabulous people arrive?

1812
01:49:37,283 --> 01:49:39,444
Well, actually,
the open house is tomorrow.

1813
01:49:39,619 --> 01:49:41,883
But I have this one buyer...

1814
01:49:42,054 --> 01:49:45,615
...and I wanted to make sure
his girlfriend likes it first.

1815
01:49:46,192 --> 01:49:48,524
Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?

1816
01:49:50,062 --> 01:49:52,030
Yeah, I have an idea.

1817
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:53,426
For this house.

1818
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:54,725
For me.

1819
01:49:54,901 --> 01:49:57,665
And hopefully, if you like it...

1820
01:49:57,837 --> 01:50:00,431
...and things continue to, you know...

1821
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:03,440
Anna...

1822
01:50:03,609 --> 01:50:05,668
...I have a plan, okay?

1823
01:50:05,845 --> 01:50:08,814
I know where my life is going,
and I want you to go with me.

1824
01:50:08,981 --> 01:50:11,245
I'm not saying I want you
to move in right now...

1825
01:50:11,417 --> 01:50:15,353
...but I don't want to buy this place
unless, at some point...

1826
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:17,785
...you could see yourself moving in.

1827
01:50:18,357 --> 01:50:20,052
So, what do you think?

1828
01:50:21,627 --> 01:50:23,891
I can't do this.

1829
01:50:24,864 --> 01:50:26,491
Okay.

1830
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:30,568
Well, if it's too fast,
I guess we can always just...

1831
01:50:30,735 --> 01:50:32,965
I can't do any of this.

1832
01:50:33,672 --> 01:50:35,003
I mean...

1833
01:50:35,173 --> 01:50:39,610
...what you're saying
and what you're offering...

1834
01:50:39,778 --> 01:50:42,838
...is what every girl wants.

1835
01:50:43,014 --> 01:50:45,346
It's what I always wanted.

1836
01:50:45,517 --> 01:50:47,508
It's just...

1837
01:50:54,292 --> 01:50:55,554
You don't want it with me.

1838
01:51:16,414 --> 01:51:17,438
Okay.

1839
01:51:18,917 --> 01:51:20,782
I have a question.

1840
01:51:22,187 --> 01:51:24,485
Is there any way we could...

1841
01:51:25,423 --> 01:51:28,449
...dial it back to before,
when we were just sleeping together...

1842
01:51:28,627 --> 01:51:32,688
...because I don't know,
I felt like that gelled.

1843
01:51:46,611 --> 01:51:48,169
Babe?

1844
01:52:22,846 --> 01:52:24,074
It was nice meeting you.

1845
01:52:24,248 --> 01:52:26,512
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.

1846
01:52:26,684 --> 01:52:28,481
You too.

1847
01:52:34,825 --> 01:52:35,849
Good night.

1848
01:52:54,912 --> 01:52:57,005
You forget something?

1849
01:52:57,981 --> 01:52:59,972
Yeah, I did.

1850
01:53:00,784 --> 01:53:03,014
Really? What did you forget?

1851
01:53:06,724 --> 01:53:08,191
This.

1852
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:17,490
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen?

1853
01:53:17,668 --> 01:53:18,760
Yeah.

1854
01:53:18,936 --> 01:53:24,272
I thought I should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here.

1855
01:53:24,441 --> 01:53:26,534
That's how it's done, isn't it?

1856
01:53:27,978 --> 01:53:29,309
Sometimes.

1857
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,040
Look, I can't stop thinking about you.

1858
01:53:32,516 --> 01:53:33,710
It's a problem.

1859
01:53:33,884 --> 01:53:38,115
I drive by your place, I call and hang up.

1860
01:53:38,287 --> 01:53:39,311
I'm turning into...

1861
01:53:39,489 --> 01:53:40,979
Me.

1862
01:53:41,924 --> 01:53:43,585
Yeah.

1863
01:53:46,696 --> 01:53:49,028
A wise person once told me...

1864
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:53,999
...that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen, no matter what.

1865
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:55,262
That's true.

1866
01:53:55,438 --> 01:53:58,464
But when I was hurling my body
onto yours...

1867
01:53:58,641 --> 01:54:00,768
...you did not seem
to want to make it happen.

1868
01:54:00,943 --> 01:54:04,276
Yeah, all right.
Here's the thing about that:

1869
01:54:04,447 --> 01:54:05,880
You were right.

1870
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:09,745
I've gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women...

1871
01:54:09,919 --> 01:54:11,284
...and having the power...

1872
01:54:11,454 --> 01:54:13,581
...that I didn't know what it felt like...

1873
01:54:13,756 --> 01:54:15,951
...when I actually fell...

1874
01:54:16,125 --> 01:54:18,286
...for one of them.

1875
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:23,298
I didn't know.

1876
01:54:32,341 --> 01:54:34,707
Look, I just went out
with your friend Bill and...

1877
01:54:34,877 --> 01:54:35,935
Yeah.

1878
01:54:36,112 --> 01:54:38,672
He might be just exactly what I need.

1879
01:54:38,848 --> 01:54:40,577
No drama.

1880
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,048
He calls, he does what he says.

1881
01:54:43,219 --> 01:54:45,346
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.

1882
01:54:45,521 --> 01:54:48,046
And that same wise person told me
that I am the rule.

1883
01:54:48,224 --> 01:54:51,819
That I have to stop thinking
that every guy will change.

1884
01:54:51,994 --> 01:54:54,258
That I have to stop thinking that...

1885
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:13,343
I'm the exception.

1886
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:19,011
You are my exception.

1887
01:56:02,364 --> 01:56:03,388
Conor Barry.

1888
01:56:03,565 --> 01:56:05,999
<i>Hi, it's Mary at the Blade.</i>

1889
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:08,465
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

1890
01:56:09,404 --> 01:56:11,964
Really? You don't think the muscle T
is too much?

1891
01:56:12,641 --> 01:56:16,407
I think the shirt you're wearing now
is probably more you.

1892
01:56:18,313 --> 01:56:19,644
What, you here?

1893
01:56:19,814 --> 01:56:22,009
I'm sitting right in front of you.

1894
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,251
Wow, this is you. Mary.

1895
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:26,478
It's me.

1896
01:56:26,655 --> 01:56:27,883
I'm me.

1897
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,091
Should I...?

1898
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:34,692
<i>- Please. Please.
- Okay.</i>

1899
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:36,888
<i>- Talk to you in a minute.
- See you in a second.</i>

1900
01:56:37,065 --> 01:56:38,930
Okay.

1901
01:56:40,669 --> 01:56:42,261
Hey.

1902
01:56:42,437 --> 01:56:43,734
- Hi.
- How are you?

1903
01:56:43,905 --> 01:56:45,303
It's nice to finally meet you.

1904
01:56:45,472 --> 01:56:46,530
- You too.
- In person.

1905
01:56:47,107 --> 01:56:49,302
This is a pleasant surprise.

1906
01:56:49,476 --> 01:56:50,704
- You...
- What?

1907
01:56:50,878 --> 01:56:54,006
- I don't know. Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?

1908
01:56:54,181 --> 01:56:56,547
Your voice does not match your face
in a good way.

1909
01:56:56,717 --> 01:56:59,743
In a... Yeah, I mean...
That sounded terrible.

1910
01:57:04,391 --> 01:57:06,120
Amazing.

1911
01:57:06,293 --> 01:57:08,625
I don't know how all this stuff
fit in here before.

1912
01:57:08,796 --> 01:57:11,697
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

1913
01:57:20,607 --> 01:57:24,976
You are not trying
to get these back in here.

1914
01:57:25,145 --> 01:57:28,080
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
- We had a deal, mister.

1915
01:57:28,248 --> 01:57:29,613
These are not staying.

1916
01:57:29,783 --> 01:57:34,117
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

1917
01:57:34,288 --> 01:57:36,756
They could be pressed,
flattened, you can...

1918
01:57:36,924 --> 01:57:40,382
If you're gonna throw them out,
at least check the pockets, all right?

1919
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:44,190
So you don't throw away
some personal items.

1920
01:58:01,448 --> 01:58:04,679
I love you so much.

1921
01:58:05,419 --> 01:58:07,011
So much.

1922
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:09,816
And I wanna make you happy.

1923
01:58:10,457 --> 01:58:12,391
I need to make you happy...

1924
01:58:12,559 --> 01:58:16,825
...for me to even have a shot
at being happy.

1925
01:58:18,131 --> 01:58:23,330
Will you marry me?

1926
01:58:28,941 --> 01:58:32,536
Yes, of course I will. Yes.

1927
01:58:32,712 --> 01:58:34,270
Yes.

1928
01:58:38,885 --> 01:58:40,682
Thank God.

1929
01:58:47,026 --> 01:58:49,586
<i>If a guy punches you, he likes you.</i>

1930
01:58:49,762 --> 01:58:51,992
<i>Never try to trim your own bangs.</i>

1931
01:58:52,165 --> 01:58:57,125
<i>And someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending.</i>

1932
01:58:57,303 --> 01:58:58,964
- and your commitment to each other.

1933
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,873
<i>Every movie we see,
every story we're told...</i>

1934
01:59:04,043 --> 01:59:05,738
<i>... implores us to wait for it.</i>

1935
01:59:06,546 --> 01:59:12,382
<i>The third act twist:
The unexpected declaration of love.</i>

1936
01:59:13,352 --> 01:59:15,479
<i>The exception to the rule.</i>

1937
01:59:15,655 --> 01:59:19,216
<i>But sometimes we're so focused
on finding our happy ending...</i>

1938
01:59:19,392 --> 01:59:22,088
<i>... we don't learn how to read the signs.</i>

1939
01:59:22,261 --> 01:59:25,196
<i>How to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who don't.</i>

1940
01:59:25,364 --> 01:59:28,663
<i>The ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave.</i>

1941
01:59:37,243 --> 01:59:39,108
- Hi.
- Hi.

1942
01:59:39,645 --> 01:59:44,014
<i>And maybe this happy ending
doesn't include a wonderful guy.</i>

1943
01:59:45,351 --> 01:59:48,343
<i>Maybe it's you...</i>

1944
01:59:49,889 --> 01:59:51,788
<i>... on your own...</i>

1945
01:59:51,957 --> 01:59:55,017
<i>... picking up the pieces and starting over.</i>

1946
01:59:56,361 --> 02:00:00,320
<i>Freeing yourself up
for something better in the future.</i>

1947
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:05,035
<i>Maybe the happy ending is just...</i>

1948
02:00:05,604 --> 02:00:07,538
<i>... moving on.</i>

1949
02:00:11,343 --> 02:00:14,779
Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn.
Forget the dip. Come on, come on.

1950
02:00:14,946 --> 02:00:17,005
Let's go, Alex.

1951
02:00:17,182 --> 02:00:18,774
Come on, Alex, your turn.

1952
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:20,212
Ready? LOL.

1953
02:00:20,385 --> 02:00:22,751
Laugh out loud! We won!

1954
02:00:24,956 --> 02:00:28,824
<i>Knowing that through all the unreturned
phone calls and broken hearts...</i>

1955
02:00:28,994 --> 02:00:32,486
<i>... through all the blunders
and misread signals...</i>

1956
02:00:32,664 --> 02:00:35,633
<i>... through all of the pain
and embarrassment...</i>

1957
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,668
<i>... you never, ever gave up hope.</i>

1958
02:00:46,912 --> 02:00:48,470
<i>Now that we are married...</i>

1959
02:00:48,647 --> 02:00:49,909
<i>We're gonna move.</i>

1960
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:52,049
<i>Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.</i>

1961
02:00:52,217 --> 02:00:56,210
<i>Another thing we're gonna do
is move a little further away from...</i>

1962
02:00:56,388 --> 02:00:59,152
<i>- Baltimore?
- Your sisters.</i>

1963
02:00:59,824 --> 02:01:01,724
<i>I mean, everyone makes mistakes.</i>

1964
02:01:01,893 --> 02:01:06,887
<i>I've started trying to figure out what
I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?</i>

1965
02:01:07,065 --> 02:01:10,694
<i>Probably seems the wrong time to do that,
but why not? You know, why not?</i>

1966
02:01:10,869 --> 02:01:12,200
<i>Better later than never.</i>

1967
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:14,065
<i>I'm dating now.</i>

1968
02:01:16,374 --> 02:01:18,968
<i>What do you miss most about marriage?</i>

1969
02:01:19,144 --> 02:01:20,611
<i>Have you been married?</i>

1970
02:01:20,779 --> 02:01:21,837
<i>Yes, I'm married.</i>

1971
02:01:22,013 --> 02:01:23,640
<i>- You are married?
- I am married.</i>

1972
02:01:23,815 --> 02:01:25,645
<i>And what's your question?</i>

1973
02:01:25,816 --> 02:01:29,650
<i>We're heading there, is that fair?
- It's moving fast. Just on our way.</i>

1974
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:32,584
<i>I like him, I'll say that L word.</i>

1975
02:01:32,756 --> 02:01:35,725
<i>That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah.</i>

1976
02:01:35,893 --> 02:01:38,293
<i>I like her a lot, so...</i>

1977
02:01:38,462 --> 02:01:41,022
<i>- Good, I'm glad.
I love her. I love her.</i>

1978
02:01:41,732 --> 02:01:44,200
<i>You know, what I've been focusing
my energy on...</i>

1979
02:01:44,368 --> 02:01:48,202
<i>... is like a self-discovery,
as opposed to dating.</i>

1980
02:01:48,372 --> 02:01:50,806
<i>I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.</i>

1981
02:01:50,975 --> 02:01:55,742
<i>Good friend of mine and I
are going to India for a few months.</i>

1982
02:01:55,913 --> 02:01:57,312
<i>We're going on a yoga retreat.</i>

1983
02:01:57,481 --> 02:01:59,745
<i>I really genuinely love this person...</i>

1984
02:01:59,917 --> 02:02:01,782
<i>He had asked me to co-host this party...</i>

1985
02:02:01,952 --> 02:02:03,180
<i>... and I stayed after.</i>

1986
02:02:03,354 --> 02:02:07,017
<i>I was trying to help you out because
there was this girl who would not leave...</i>

1987
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:09,955
<i>- ... that tall girl.
- Right. She was gross.</i>

1988
02:02:10,127 --> 02:02:11,492
<i>I was trying to...</i>

1989
02:02:11,662 --> 02:02:13,493
<i>She was... Come on.</i>
