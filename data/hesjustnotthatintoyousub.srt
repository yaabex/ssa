1
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:39,348
<i>A girl will never forget</i>
<i>the first boy she likes.</i>

2
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:44,991
<i>Even if things don't quite work out.</i>

3
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,627
Why did you do that?

4
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:49,897
Because you smell like dog poo.

5
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:52,796
You're so stupid, just like dog poo.

6
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,368
You're made out of poo!

7
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:59,066
<i>But usually someone is there</i>
<i>to offer words of wisdom.</i>

8
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:00,470
Made...

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,008
...of...

10
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,810
...dog...

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,311
...poo.

12
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,779
Honey...

13
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,183
...do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things?

14
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:14,186
It's because he likes you.

15
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,587
<i>And there it is.</i>

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,388
<i>That's the beginning of our problem.</i>

17
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:25,699
That little boy is doing those terrible things
because he's got a crush on you.

18
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,200
<i>Do you know
what this means?</i>

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,496
<i>We're all encouraged...</i>

20
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,831
<i>... no, programmed...</i>

21
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,531
<i>... to believe that if a guy</i>
<i>acts like a total jerk...</i>

22
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,177
<i>... that means he likes you.</i>

23
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,272
Here's the problem:
He likes you too much.

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,315
You're too pretty and too awesome.

25
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,578
- Yes.
- He can't handle it.

26
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,687
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

27
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,054
I'm sure he just lost your number.

28
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:58,192
He's not asking you out because he's
intimidated by your professional success.

29
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:11,945
Trust me. It's because he's just
getting out of a serious relationship.

30
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,144
Trust me. It's because he's never had
a serious relationship.

31
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,666
<i>Why do we say this stuff
to each other?</i>

32
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,295
<i>Is it possible that it's because</i>
<i>we're too scared...</i>

33
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,667
<i>... and it's too hard to say</i>
<i>the one obvious truth...</i>

34
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,833
<i>... that's staring everyone in the face?</i>

35
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,719
So Janine says
you're a real-estate agent.

36
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,126
Yeah, but I'm not
one of those cheesy ones...

37
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:05,233
...that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts.

38
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,733
So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?

39
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Basically.

40
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,005
- It's much classier.
- My thoughts exactly.

41
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,372
Wonder why Janine never thought
to introduce us before.

42
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,310
I don't know. I don't know.

43
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:22,542
- Hey, guys. Want another round?
- You want one more?

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,885
Only if you do. I mean,
if you need to get going, I totally...

45
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,387
Uh...

46
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,154
Okay, well...

47
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,359
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

48
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,826
And a beer, please.

49
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:41,868
Be right back.

50
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,866
Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
- It was really nice meeting you.

51
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,475
- Bye.
- See you.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,744
Hey, it's me.

53
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,356
He's cute, and I think it went well.

54
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:06,086
And I think he might be leaving me
a message at home as we speak.

55
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:10,323
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.

56
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,425
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
Conor. Thanks.

57
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,595
Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to grab a late bite.

58
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,303
Tonight? I...

59
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:23,536
No, I was supposed to meet friends
but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

60
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,341
<i>No, of course, I'm not mad.</i>
<i>Well, I'll be up for a while.</i>

61
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,416
- Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- <i>I'll be up.</i>

62
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,846
- Oh, can you hold on?
- <i>Okay.</i>

63
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,214
No, that's fine.
You just have one thing, so...

64
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,185
No, technically I have six...

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,918
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,
so I think you should go.

66
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,459
Okay.

67
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,891
Let me call you right back.

68
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,088
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

69
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:43,960
- Hi.
- Hey.

70
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,294
Just that and that, please.

71
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,300
Thank you.

72
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:53,973
Oh, my word.

73
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:57,245
Seriously? That's not possible.

74
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:00,439
I just deposited cash three days ago,
so it's just not possible.

75
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,414
Oh, it's not that.
Let me check something.

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,585
Congratulations, you won.

77
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:07,613
What?

78
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,851
Our Funky Fall promotion.
You're our 1000th customer this month.

79
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,586
What?

80
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,399
Are you kidding me?

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,731
I don't do kidding.

82
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,571
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this, it's so exciting.

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,846
Oh, my God.
I never won anything before.

84
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:34,450
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

85
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,548
Yea-- No.
I don't think so.

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,120
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,348
Thank you! Come here.

88
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,849
Wow.

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,690
<i>...as the Terps move</i>
<i>to mid-ice, trying to...</i>

90
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

91
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,837
- How was the date?
- It was fine. Whatever.

92
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,972
- Why are you here?
- My cable's out.

93
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,473
Come on, Spiewak,
it's not the Ice Capades.

94
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,407
You didn't hear the phone ring
by any chance, did you?

95
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,911
- No, I didn't.
- Shit.

96
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,778
Anna gave me the old,
"I'll call you right back."

97
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,010
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?

98
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,953
That was 22 minutes ago.

99
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,848
Do I call back?

100
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,119
Should you call back? No, absolutely not.

101
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,796
I'm gonna call back
and say I'm going to bed.

102
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,729
What? No. It's 9:30.
You're gonna--?

103
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,062
No, it's a great idea.

104
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,262
I'll call and say, "In case you were
gonna call me back, don't...

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,567
...because I'll be sleeping."
A genius idea.

106
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,004
Okay, no,
that's brilliant.

107
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,374
When you wake up you can say, "I'm awake
now, I'm available to take your call."

108
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,609
Oh, gosh. A second.

109
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,217
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,549
I was--

111
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,518
Wait, what was I saying again?

112
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,653
You don't wanna be like your mother,
wake up one morning...

113
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,761
...and realize
you never pursued your dreams.

114
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:54,191
Is that what I was saying?

115
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,990
- You want some gum?
- No, thank you.

116
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,999
God, that's kind of heavy
for a grocery chat.

117
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,399
- No, that's okay.
- Isn't it?

118
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:05,006
- Sorry.
- I actually might be able to help.

119
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,440
Yeah, I know a guy at my office
who deals exclusively with music clients.

120
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:10,704
- Are you kidding?
- Uh-uh.

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,541
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,013
- Are you my savior or something?
- No.

123
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,017
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,253
Oh, this is so unexpected.

125
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,561
Okay...

126
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,761
I don't...

127
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm married.

128
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,439
I don't do this.

129
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,943
You don't do what?
You don't help struggling singers?

130
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:51,151
Not hot yoga-instructing singers...

131
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:54,181
...who are incredibly charming.

132
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,523
Hm.

133
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,391
Well, you could--
You could give me your card.

134
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,965
That's legit, right? Is that allowed?

135
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,226
I could do that.

136
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,165
- Yeah.
- That'd be okay, right?

137
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,998
Yeah.

138
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,739
Great, thank you so much.

139
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,639
Course. Do you need help to your car?

140
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:18,075
- Where'd you park?
- No, I'm fine. It's okay.

141
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,482
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,312
Okay.

143
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,426
Who was that?

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,796
- Oh, that was a prospective client.
- Oh.

145
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,096
Okay.

146
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,303
I can talk to a woman.
It doesn't have to be like that.

147
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,377
No. Absolutely not.

148
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,811
- Just drive.
- Relax.

149
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,735
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:17,065
- How you doing?
- Good.

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,209
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just got off the phone.

152
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,401
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my little sister.

153
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,479
- How's she doing?
- She's getting married.

154
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,414
Really?

155
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,982
Yeah.

156
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,277
Great.

157
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,852
You really think that's great?

158
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,613
Yeah.

159
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,916
Devon seems like...

160
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,821
...a great guy.

161
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,695
Well, so you think it's great
that they're getting married...

162
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:49,304
...but you don't ever feel like
we're going against nature, or something...

163
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,804
...by not getting married?

164
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,501
No.

165
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,946
Going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

166
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:04,382
You and I are just two people
who happen not to be married.

167
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:08,120
Let me tell you something. People
who get married are not to be trusted.

168
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,486
You are so weird.

169
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,888
They're not. You know why?

170
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,791
Because if you are so legitimately happy,
honestly...

171
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:17,660
...you wouldn't feel the need
to make a big show out of it.

172
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,528
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

173
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,465
They do it because they're insecure...

174
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:24,868
...and they think getting married's
what they're supposed to be doing.

175
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,601
So they're lying to themselves
and to other people.

176
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,108
Seriously.

177
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,645
Think about you and your friends.
Okay?

178
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,010
These women you have
great relationships with...

179
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:38,051
...you're close to them,
some of them you've known for years.

180
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,653
But you don't feel the need...

181
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:45,260
...to write a $45 check to the state
of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

182
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,089
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Right?

183
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,323
Why should it be any different,
you know, with me and you?

184
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,094
We're very happy, I love you,
I'm committed to you...

185
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,500
...we have a great life, you know?

186
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,696
Yes, you're right.

187
00:10:57,873 --> 00:11:00,967
Why can't we just be happy?

188
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,804
You're right.

189
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:05,572
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.
- Okay.

190
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,817
<i>Please enter your pass--</i>

191
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,515
<i>You have no messages.</i>

192
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,593
<i>Main menu.
To send a message--</i>

193
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,623
Okay, so clearly he hasn't called.

194
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,598
Maybe he's away on business.

195
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,796
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

196
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,305
- Staying in town is his business.
- Right.

197
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,205
Well, look, let me tell you.

198
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:39,144
After I went out with Ben for the first
time, he didn't call me for 11 days.

199
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,840
Eleven days. And now
he's the world's best husband.

200
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,211
That happens all the time.

201
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,614
- Really?
- Really.

202
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,918
You want coffee?

203
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,557
- I got you 2 percent.
- Thanks.

204
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,654
This is all your fault.

205
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,662
What? Why?

206
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,357
You set us up.

207
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:05,371
No. You asked me if I know any guys,
and I gave Conor your phone number.

208
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,168
That's not a setup.

209
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:10,141
When I do a setup,
I weigh the pros and cons.

210
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,371
I do my due diligence.

211
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:17,008
All I know about Conor
is that he sold us this house.

212
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,047
Seriously, stop.

213
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,794
He said he always hangs out after work
at the City Supper Club.

214
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,192
Maybe I should do
a little drive-by?

215
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,364
Please don't.

216
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:33,596
He'll call.

217
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,166
<i>Okay, I have a question:</i>

218
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,935
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

219
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:45,376
It's, like, who is this service helping?

220
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,413
I mean, for centuries...

221
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay, well maybe not centuries,
but for, like, a lot and lot of years...

222
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,914
...people have been answering their phone,
not knowing who it is...

223
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,524
...and as far as I can tell,
no one's died from that.

224
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:02,392
And it's like if the police wanna know
who placed a call, they could trace it.

225
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,055
I mean, what am I, the police?

226
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,964
This constant obsession with needing
to know who's calling all the time...

227
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:09,399
...it's, like, so gross.

228
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:13,201
Like, you pick up the phone,
you find out who it is, then you know.

229
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,842
It's, like...

230
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,476
Look, all I'm saying...

231
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:22,248
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...

232
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:25,444
...to call him at 15-minute intervals
until he picks up.

233
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,748
But if he looks down
and sees my numbers...

234
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:31,222
...he's gonna think
I'm some kind of psycho or something.

235
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,525
Which I'm not.

236
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,391
Obviously.

237
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,035
Hello?

238
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,696
Mom.

239
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,809
I gotta call you back.

240
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,479
Inhale.
Upward-facing dog.

241
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,014
Look up towards the ceiling.

242
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,948
Look up towards the ceiling.

243
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,888
He ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came.

244
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,990
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

245
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,649
He initiated the hug.
He said it was nice meeting me.

246
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:09,855
So wait. This was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date?

247
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,330
End. Why, does it matter?

248
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,834
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
of the date, that's normal.

249
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,269
"Nice meeting you"
at the end of the date...

250
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,331
It could be a blowoff.

251
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,375
Maybe it was at the beginning.

252
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:25,605
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

253
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,214
Or maybe it was at the end.

254
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,442
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

255
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,108
Help.

256
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,551
Hi. This is torture.

257
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:36,657
How am I supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic...

258
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,292
...to say about cinnamon blends?

259
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,927
It's hard to focus on nutmeg...

260
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,529
...when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams...

261
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,996
...refuses to call me.

262
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,768
After my first date with Neil...

263
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:48,961
...I called him.

264
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,933
There are no rules anymore.

265
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:55,702
And, I mean, why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass?

266
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:03,309
- It's ringing.
- That's pretty standard.

267
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,350
- <i>Hey, you've reached Conor.</i>
- Yes! Voicemail.

268
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,354
- <i>Leave a message, I'll get back to you.</i>
- Notes.

269
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,355
"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.

270
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,494
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...

271
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:17,894
...and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"

272
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:22,029
<i>What does that say?
What's that say?</i>

273
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,202
Because we're all equal, right?

274
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,239
More than equal.

275
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:30,242
More women are accepted
into law school now than men.

276
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,846
And, I mean, I don't know
if you saw that <i>Dateline...</i>

277
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,677
...but women practically
have penises now, right? So...

278
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,809
Call me.

279
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,455
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.

280
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,756
Don't worry, he's totally gonna call.

281
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:05,812
What?

282
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:09,280
How can there not be a dial tone?
How can there not be a dial tone?

283
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,877
No dial tone. Come here, dial tone.

284
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,282
<i>Gigi, are you there?</i>

285
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:14,820
<i>Hello, Gigi?</i>

286
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,423
- Mom, is that you?
- <i>Yes.</i>

287
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:20,255
- I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
- <i>Wait, I need you to--</i>

288
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,494
<i>Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.</i>

289
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,071
Hi, Janine, it's me.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,366
Conor never called...

291
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:37,274
...so I'm on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.

292
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,346
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

293
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,415
All right, I'm interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance. Bye.

294
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,282
- What's up, girl?
- Hey.

295
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,620
- How are you?
- Good.

296
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,759
Knock, knock.

297
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,300
Hey.

298
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,704
So...

299
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,006
...here we are. Same shift again.

300
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,441
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

301
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,014
Well, I figured it was no coincidence.

302
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,049
I had...

303
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,323
...a good time the other night.

304
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,986
Yeah.

305
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,720
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patrón will get you.

306
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,494
So I was thinking...

307
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,765
...after work we could...

308
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,830
You know...

309
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:45,537
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

310
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:46,874
It was definitely fun.

311
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,950
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

312
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,145
So that's why I scheduled you.

313
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,187
To work.

314
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,984
So...

315
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,090
Are we good?

316
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,556
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

317
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:05,961
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

318
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,535
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

319
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,881
Hi. Are you joining us
for dinner, or?

320
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,381
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

321
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,019
- Why?
- Hm?

322
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,052
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

323
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:29,848
I'll wait at the bar.

324
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:32,951
That's a great idea.

325
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,701
What can I get you?

326
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,270
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

327
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:47,135
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

328
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,873
I don't know if you'd call it "hot."

329
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,309
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time--

330
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,073
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

331
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,540
Yeah.

332
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,708
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

333
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,446
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

334
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:04,490
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

335
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,685
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting."

336
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,921
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

337
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

338
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:15,733
Okay.

339
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,701
I just was actually in the area...

340
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,138
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

341
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,610
Because I had to return his pen.

342
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,879
Had to return this pen. He left this.

343
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,010
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

344
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,617
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

345
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,616
Thanks.

346
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,463
"Wilson Ward, DDS,
Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry."

347
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,900
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

348
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,595
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

349
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,501
Oh, really. Who is?

350
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,967
My dad.

351
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,209
Oh.

352
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,753
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

353
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,324
And I just...

354
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,928
I thought if I just ran into him...

355
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,858
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

356
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,662
Wait.

357
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:22,861
Wait, just--

358
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,131
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

359
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,867
One drink. Okay?

360
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,976
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

361
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,715
Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

362
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,185
Conor's never gonna call you.

363
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,950
Oh, really. How do you know?

364
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,651
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

365
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,295
He said it was nice meeting me.

366
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,988
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

367
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,498
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

368
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,832
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

369
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,633
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

370
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,207
Or maybe he lost my number...

371
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:05,403
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

372
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,572
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

373
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:14,181
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

374
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,914
She totally wrote him off.

375
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,786
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

376
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,621
She ran into him,
and it ended up that--

377
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,457
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

378
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,622
...by the way.
The rare exception.

379
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,667
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

380
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,600
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

381
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:35,175
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

382
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,971
- Really?
- Yeah.

383
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,942
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

384
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:43,141
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

385
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,786
I do it early, I do it often.

386
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:50,414
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

387
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:53,083
...he genuinely
doesn't give a shit.

388
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,126
No exceptions.

389
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,035
Thank you.

390
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,335
Given me a lot to think about.

391
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,686
- Morning, morning.
- Excuse me.

392
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,014
- Hi.
- Hi.

393
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,450
Everything okay?

394
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,749
Oh, I was up all night.

395
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,949
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

396
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,255
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

397
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,295
Sweetie?
What's going on with your hair?

398
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:33,798
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

399
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,630
Okay.

400
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,135
So...

401
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,472
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

402
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,771
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

403
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,246
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

404
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,512
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

405
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,555
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

406
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,659
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

407
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,795
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

408
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,022
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

409
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,427
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

410
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:11,401
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

411
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:15,407
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

412
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:18,102
And then... Oh, there was Don...

413
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,841
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

414
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:23,917
I was delusional about that relationship.

415
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,577
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

416
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:29,019
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

417
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,819
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

418
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,791
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

419
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:36,931
...and that girl ended up getting married.

420
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,159
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

421
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,972
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

422
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:50,844
So what you're saying is...

423
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,311
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

424
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,008
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

425
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,812
Yes.

426
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,854
But the rule are guys like Neil...

427
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:05,956
...who are with girls like me...

428
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,653
...for seven years and aren't married...

429
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,388
...they're never getting married.

430
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,231
- No.
- No.

431
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,924
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

432
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:17,970
- It's not what she meant in that--
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

433
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,267
I absolutely was not talking about you.

434
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:24,378
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

435
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,140
Just me specifically,
you know?

436
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,248
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

437
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:37,687
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

438
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,955
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

439
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,121
And then he tells me that he's married.

440
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,733
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

441
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,928
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

442
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,299
But he's married.

443
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,909
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

444
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,338
What's wrong with me?

445
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,369
Okay.

446
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,312
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

447
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:07,080
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

448
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:11,954
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

449
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:16,461
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

450
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,999
That he had finally met the one.

451
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,931
So he divorced his wife...

452
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,368
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

453
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,838
...and they're insanely happy.

454
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,603
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

455
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,872
...but you already married someone else?

456
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,175
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

457
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,955
You're right. Okay.

458
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:42,782
I'm gonna call him.

459
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,116
Okay.

460
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,966
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.

461
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,544
<i>Hey, Anna. What's up?</i>

462
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:08,808
Nothing, I was just--
I was taking you up on your offer.

463
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,421
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

464
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:18,855
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

465
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,294
<i>Look, I just...</i>

466
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,102
<i>I can't, Anna.</i>

467
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,762
<i>You seemed great. I just--</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

468
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,908
<i>I should probably go.</i>

469
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,770
<i>Take care, though. Bye.</i>

470
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:44,778
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:46,352
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

472
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,955
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

473
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,785
I was just thinking about you.

474
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,756
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

475
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,758
Okay, what were the categories again?

476
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,760
Four categories:

477
00:26:56,931 --> 00:27:00,492
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

478
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,830
But you can only be two things.

479
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:07,338
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

480
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,477
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

481
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:11,475
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

482
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,170
Go. What am I?

483
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,508
Wait, what was I again?

484
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,514
You're smart and cute.

485
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,711
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

486
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,412
And cute.

487
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,086
No, you can't--

488
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,386
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

489
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,324
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

490
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:32,455
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,
which obviously you are.

491
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,829
Especially sexy.

492
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,834
You're the best.

493
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,567
I better go.

494
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:47,938
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

495
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,381
What? It's been a while.

496
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,281
No, I can't.

497
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,888
I can't stay, I'm totally--

498
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,648
I'm totally, totally fried.

499
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,019
Is that okay?

500
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,626
Yeah.

501
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:05,757
I'll see you later.

502
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,367
Bye.

503
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,304
Hey.

504
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,438
That look straight to you?

505
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,811
Why are you hanging that?

506
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,847
Because you asked me to
about three weeks ago.

507
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,217
I'm getting around to it.

508
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,417
Why? You don't want it here?

509
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,289
No, I love it there. But just stop.

510
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,920
Why? Is it the painting?

511
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:42,058
You know, I know, it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here.

512
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:43,534
Right? I know.

513
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:46,173
It's gonna be depressing.
Should I take it down?

514
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,208
No, I want you
to stop doing anything nice.

515
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,376
This feels like a trick.

516
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,016
- No.
- No?

517
00:28:56,184 --> 00:29:00,177
No, I just-- I just need you
to stop being nice to me...

518
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:02,346
...unless you're gonna marry me after.

519
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:06,049
Is that funny?

520
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:07,694
Do you think that's funny?

521
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,221
No, I guess it's not funny.

522
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,333
See, you can't keep being nice to me...

523
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,198
...and I can't keep pretending
that this is something that it's not.

524
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,666
We've been together
for over seven years.

525
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,366
You know me, you know who I am.

526
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:25,377
You either wanna marry me
or you don't.

527
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,248
Or there's the possibility...

528
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:33,750
...that I mean it when I say
I don't believe in marriage--

529
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,389
Bullshit.

530
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:36,581
Bullshit.

531
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,090
Come on, it's bullshit for every woman...

532
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,855
...that has been told by some man
that he doesn't believe in marriage...

533
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:48,492
...and then six months later he's married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

534
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,570
It's just--
It's bullshit.

535
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,205
Where is this coming from?

536
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,399
From the place I've been hiding
from you for about five years.

537
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:56,601
Okay.

538
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,372
Five years, because I haven't wanted
to seem demanding.

539
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:04,143
And I haven't wanted
to seem clingy or psycho.

540
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,444
Or whatever.

541
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,748
So I haven't asked you.

542
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,821
But I...

543
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,725
I have to.

544
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,029
I mean...

545
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:24,503
...are you ever gonna marry me?

546
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:45,158
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

547
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:05,138
<i>I used to think that I had</i>
<i>never been dumped.</i>

548
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,304
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.

549
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:11,509
Then we realized we've both been dumped
by every man we've ever been with.

550
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,313
- Every one.
- Yeah.

551
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:16,013
- But they do it so skillfully.
- Mm-hm.

552
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,523
They just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea.

553
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,924
Yeah. You're sitting back
and you're like:

554
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:25,964
"Oh, yeah. This my idea.
But wait a second, why am I alone?"

555
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,625
"Why am I unhappy?
Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

556
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,203
- They Jedi mind-trick you.
- Yes, they do.

557
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,805
- So they do a soft pass.
- Yeah.

558
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,033
They got little lines they like to tell you.

559
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,074
Like, "I don't wanna stand in your way."

560
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:40,646
Or, "You're perfect,
it's just I have to work on myself."

561
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,874
Right. "I'm just thinking
of your happiness."

562
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:45,645
"Oh, I don't deserve you."
That's my favorite one.

563
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,219
You know the other one I like?

564
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,856
"I am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you."

565
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,821
- Well, that could have been you.
- Yeah.

566
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,688
That's what I was leaning towards.

567
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:55,829
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

568
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,989
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream...

569
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,896
...because you have been dumped.

570
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,494
Hey Anna, it's Ben.

571
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,572
Listen, I know it's been a while
since you called.

572
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,835
It's just--
It took me by surprise.

573
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,411
But I did offer to help you
with your career...

574
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,673
...and I don't see why
I can't do that, right?

575
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,441
So why don't you give me a call...

576
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,143
...and maybe you can
come by the office or something.

577
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,811
Okay? All right, take care. Bye.

578
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,116
Hey, you.

579
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,316
Oh, shit.

580
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:28,428
- What?
- You scared me.

581
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,427
- You okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,429
Everything's fine.

583
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,996
Are you smoking again?

584
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:36,227
No, sweetie, I'm not smoking.

585
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:37,428
Why?

586
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,095
You get jumpy when you smoke.

587
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:40,865
I'm not smoking, I promise.

588
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,101
No, I was just sitting here...

589
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:46,940
...trying to picture what this room's
gonna look like when it's finished.

590
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,377
- I like that game.
- You do?

591
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,948
Yeah.

592
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,577
What color did you picture?

593
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,723
That's where I got stuck.

594
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,289
Yeah.

595
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,394
I was thinking...

596
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:03,692
...maybe yellow.

597
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:07,266
- Yellow? Okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.

598
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:11,269
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. So it could be whatever.

599
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:14,931
It could be an office,
it could be a guest room...

600
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,805
...a gym, a baby's room...

601
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:24,550
Wait, did you mean "neutral,"
or "gender-neutral"?

602
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:28,280
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

603
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:32,920
I know we said
we'd wait to talk about it.

604
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,823
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

605
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:41,431
But I think that we're almost ready
to start talking about it.

606
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,379
So that's the last time
I do anything pro bono.

607
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:06,650
Well, ladies, I guess
I have to get back to the office.

608
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,492
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?

609
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,223
I met you.

610
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:17,026
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?

611
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,033
- Of course.
- Oh, great.

612
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,371
Here is my info.

613
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,471
- Nice to meet you, Janine.
- Nice to meet you.

614
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,876
Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

615
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,575
Oh, wait.

616
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,318
So...

617
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,156
...how are we doing this?

618
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,317
Are you hearing from me
or am I getting a call?

619
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,519
What?

620
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,690
You said you'd love to call me...

621
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,766
...but then you said,
"Look forward to hearing from you," and--

622
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,834
You see how that's kind of confusing?

623
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,870
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

624
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,368
You did it again. Very vague.

625
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:58,205
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me...

626
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,973
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.

627
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:03,014
Goodbye, Gigi.

628
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:16,757
- He was cute.
- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.

629
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,791
What are you doing?

630
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:22,128
I'm not calling him.

631
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:24,601
If he wants to see me, he'll call.

632
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,067
Wow.

633
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,266
That guy Alex really
made an impression on you.

634
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:30,637
Was he hot?

635
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:33,337
No. He was just...

636
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,708
...right.

637
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,715
Morning.

638
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,477
Morning, Ryan.

639
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:42,521
A surprise mocha venti
just because you're so awesome.

640
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,124
- Love you.
- Love you.

641
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:47,390
Good morning.

642
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:59,798
Okay.

643
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:04,501
So?

644
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:06,604
Oh, hi.

645
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,415
- He asked me out.
- Oh, my God. He called?

646
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,118
- Well...
- He e-mailed?

647
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:19,782
- No.
- What?

648
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,986
Left his calling card
with your lady-in-waiting?

649
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:26,963
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.

650
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,500
- Oh.
- Oh, girl, I don't know about that.

651
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:35,301
My trampy little sister says
MySpace is the new booty call.

652
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,712
Well, what am I supposed to do?

653
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,507
I mean, things have changed.

654
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:43,013
People don't meet each other
organically anymore.

655
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:47,143
If I would like to make myself seem
more attractive to the opposite sex...

656
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,381
...I don't go and get a new haircut,
I update my profile.

657
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:52,458
That's just the way it is, you know?

658
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,022
Yeah, she's right.

659
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:57,460
Back, back, back, back.

660
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,530
Ad sales, this is Mary.

661
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:04,865
Hi, Mary, this is Conor,
Anna's friend, or whatever.

662
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,063
<i>Hi.</i>

663
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,965
So, what'd you think?

664
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,475
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.

665
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,908
Oh, you have to trust me.

666
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,640
It's a burgeoning market,
you're gonna make a fortune.

667
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,944
I know. Did you have to put me
with the massage ads?

668
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,681
Well, it was either that or the page
with the personals, so...

669
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,722
<i>This page gets a lot of action.</i>

670
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:26,723
Yeah, I guess you're right.

671
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:28,555
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?

672
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:30,356
Yeah.

673
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:33,893
Okay.

674
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,366
All right, Mary,
I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

675
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:38,971
<i>Bye.</i>

676
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:42,835
What I'm trying to show you is
that there's a difference.

677
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,808
There is a difference.

678
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:48,813
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda
to sew these dresses in two weeks?

679
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,211
She wanted to do it.

680
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:53,751
Really? She told me she felt like
an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

681
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,684
- Is that not right?
- No, she didn't.

682
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,948
No?

683
00:37:57,124 --> 00:38:01,356
What's the--?
Why the big rush to get married?

684
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,863
Because I am not having my wedding
during a gross Baltimore winter...

685
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,898
...and I am not waiting till spring.

686
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,060
You are so pregnant.

687
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:11,761
Oh, God,
I'm not pregnant.

688
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:13,907
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

689
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,270
- Chug a beer then.
- No, I'm not chugging a beer.

690
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:17,468
Chug a beer.

691
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,374
We're in love,
you assholes.

692
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,108
That's what people do
when they're in love, they get married.

693
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,548
But you know what?
Not everybody gets married, you know?

694
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,216
There are many people
who never get married.

695
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,026
Well, thanks
for the inspirational pep talk.

696
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:40,258
What she meant to say was that it's fine
that you broke up with Neil.

697
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:41,458
Right.

698
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,399
Tons of people make the choice
to be alone. They're happy.

699
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,001
Look at Al Pacino.

700
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:50,439
Never been married, happy as a clam.

701
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:54,240
Would that--? Am I--?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

702
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,508
No, Bethie, we just--
We want you to be happy.

703
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,977
Well, then you should have
rethought the coral.

704
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:02,054
Oh, her face.

705
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,656
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.

706
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:05,815
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

707
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:08,928
I know, you're sensitive.
Trust me, I get it.

708
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,691
Hey, why don't you have dinner
with me and Steven and the kids...

709
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,391
...then you can just stay over--?

710
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:16,934
Why'd she wanna hang out
with you and your husband?

711
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,696
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

712
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,773
If being in this wedding is too painful--

713
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,570
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it.
Relax, relax.

714
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,344
That's enough, okay?
Seriously, you guys, I'm f--

715
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:31,679
I've gone through breakups before.
If you remember, I handle them quite well.

716
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:36,186
You've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

717
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:37,949
I can do it again.

718
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,320
I want you to stop worrying about me.

719
00:39:40,494 --> 00:39:42,359
I'm fine.

720
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,357
I know it's here
somewhere.

721
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:50,596
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.

722
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,908
Well, that's okay.
You can just call me when you find it.

723
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:01,711
I swear I didn't lure you here
under false pretenses.

724
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:03,611
I know.

725
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,149
A girl can dream, though.

726
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,215
You're just too good a guy.

727
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,192
Why are you married again?

728
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,296
Seriously, why?

729
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:26,167
No, I really think
that it would be good for me to know...

730
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,207
...why you cannot live
without this other woman.

731
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:35,775
Well, we'd been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum.

732
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,545
She said, "Either we get married
or we break up."

733
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,085
So we got married.

734
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,220
Wow. You caved.

735
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,586
It's complicated.

736
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:49,495
Really?

737
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:55,058
What? You're a dick if you date a girl
for too long and don't marry her.

738
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:58,730
You marry her and you're an asshole
for marrying before you're ready.

739
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:02,342
I mean, shit, I don't know.

740
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,385
You're really hot.

741
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:21,092
And I am obviously attracted to you.

742
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,696
So I think the best I can do is...

743
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:30,433
...eventually find this piece of paper
and call you...

744
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:34,734
...and hope to just help you out in
your career in some small way.

745
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,777
Hi.

746
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,081
Hi. What's going on?

747
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,660
Javier.

748
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,996
Javier, I thought we talked
about tarping the furniture.

749
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:48,272
City Supper.

750
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,314
<i>Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?</i>

751
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,951
Hold on.

752
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,916
- Alex?
- Yo.

753
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:56,022
- Drinks are good?
- Yeah, one more.

754
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,181
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, this is Gigi.</i>

755
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:00,190
- Gigi?
- <i>Gigi Phillips.</i>

756
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:02,989
- Huh?
- I, um...

757
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,653
...had the dentist pen.

758
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,993
<i>Right. Hey. How you doing?</i>

759
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,965
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- <i>That's okay.</i>

760
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:13,334
You had some really good insights
and I wanted to ask you a question.

761
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,998
Okay, look, now I need
to be harsh with you.

762
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,701
Conor's never gonna be
interested in you, Geege.

763
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,905
No, I know. This is about Jarrad.

764
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:23,174
<i>Jarrad.</i>

765
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,251
So we meet at happy hour
and he's completely charming--

766
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,356
Hey, give me two seconds, okay?
Two seconds, hold on.

767
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:41,658
Let me guess.
He said:

768
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:44,269
"The only thing happy
about this hour is you."

769
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:48,297
He might have used
some derivative of that.

770
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:55,137
So he says he's going to call, but then
he gives me his card and he says--

771
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:56,806
<i>Oh, he's not interested.</i>

772
00:43:56,984 --> 00:43:59,782
- You don't even know if he's called.
- Oh, did he?

773
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,411
No.

774
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,947
- <i>But I honestly think he's expect--</i>
- Okay.

775
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:09,425
Gigi, he is not interested.

776
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,025
Alex, this is jacked.

777
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,963
The hostess is giving me shit
for not wearing a black shirt.

778
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:16,534
- It's not black.
- Look at it.

779
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:19,673
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

780
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,501
This shit is black.

781
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:28,612
If a guy gives you his phone number
instead of taking yours, he's not interested.

782
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:30,374
He took mine first. Then he gave--

783
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:34,009
<i>And also, if a guy wants to see you,</i>
<i>believe me, he will see you.</i>

784
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:39,991
I once called 55 Lauren Bells
until I got the right one.

785
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:41,855
That's cute.

786
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:43,087
What happened?

787
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,721
Oh, yeah, as it turns out,
her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

788
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:51,504
Is it your sensitivity that makes you
so popular with women?

789
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,171
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

790
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:56,336
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

791
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,138
- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- <i>I know. Thank you.</i>

792
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:00,746
Sure.

793
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,678
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.

794
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:05,648
Okay, bye.

795
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:11,285
Hey, buddy, you home?

796
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,688
Yeah. Come on in.

797
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,793
Hey, you want a beer?

798
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:22,595
Or an apple martini?

799
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,101
Oh, that's funny.

800
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,802
Have you told your parents?

801
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,500
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.

802
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:32,474
By pretending to be gay?

803
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,342
No, by being
more gay-friendly.

804
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,575
Or, in real estate terms,
"gay-adjacent."

805
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,343
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

806
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,954
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.

807
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:45,683
I don't know. Dressing like that,
seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

808
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:47,326
...I think you can pull it off.

809
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,689
It's not that she won't sleep with me,
douche bag.

810
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,331
I have slept with her.
It's just she, you know...

811
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,358
Won't sleep with you anymore.

812
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,769
Pretty much, yeah.

813
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,896
What do you think?

814
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:01,438
I think you got a problem...

815
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:05,669
...because you're gonna have to beat them
away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.

816
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,108
Holy shit.

817
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:09,809
Observe your breath.

818
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:13,384
Inhale, belly rise.

819
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:18,683
And exhale, belly fall.

820
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,689
Bring your hands together
in front of your chest.

821
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:26,024
Bow your head in gratitude.

822
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:33,102
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

823
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:35,366
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.

824
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:40,803
Great class.

825
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:54,727
We ran into each other.

826
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,059
You came to my class.

827
00:46:57,965 --> 00:46:59,557
I had no idea this was your class.

828
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,569
You called to ask me
if this was my class.

829
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,102
No, you never called back.

830
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:08,207
Because you told me not to call you
if it was my class. It was.

831
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,673
- No. We just ran into each other.
- Okay.

832
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:15,474
We're just two innocent folks who happen
to be working out near each other.

833
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:17,617
Exactly.

834
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:20,948
Do you want a swim?

835
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:23,146
Sure.

836
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,597
You know, I was just thinking...

837
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,631
...why can't we be friends?

838
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:38,428
I mean, am I not allowed
to have friends anymore?

839
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:42,706
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends
with people that are hot?

840
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,572
I mean, what kind of
reverse prejudice is that?

841
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:46,940
I hear you.

842
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,604
I mean...

843
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:52,183
...am I not supposed to be friends
with a guy just because he's married?

844
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:53,376
Right.

845
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,454
Or has an insane smile?

846
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,988
Or an ass that makes me
wanna dry hump?

847
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,630
- Did you just say "dry hump"?
- Yeah.

848
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,635
Think I just fell in love.

849
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:20,008
So we're friends.

850
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:22,143
Yeah.

851
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:58,849
You wanna come in?

852
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:04,418
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.

853
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:07,856
That's okay. You can just watch.

854
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,399
You know, you may be
the best friend I've ever had.

855
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:27,178
- Hi.
- Hey.

856
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,887
- Take a shower. Hey.
- What? Hi.

857
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,047
- Honey?
- Yeah.

858
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,725
You smell weird.

859
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,988
- I smell weird?
- Yeah, different.

860
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:47,395
- Different how?
- I don't know.

861
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:50,659
Sort of an odd thing to say.

862
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:54,136
You know, maybe it was the ashtray
and cigarettes I found.

863
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:56,241
In the back yard.

864
00:49:56,943 --> 00:50:00,401
What part of
"My dad died of lung cancer"...

865
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,572
...is so hard for you
to wrap your brain around?

866
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,774
What?

867
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:08,443
Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?

868
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:14,761
Are you serious?

869
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:23,468
We have, like, 8000 undocumented
workers here daily.

870
00:50:23,637 --> 00:50:28,301
Okay, and you find an ashtray
with cigarettes in it and you think--

871
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:31,535
You automatically assume
that they're mine.

872
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:33,270
Oh, yeah.

873
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,540
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

874
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,282
I think...

875
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:45,286
...you are really freaking out.

876
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:49,459
This whole renovation thing's getting
to you because nothing's happening.

877
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:57,100
Just say no.

878
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,498
Get it out.

879
00:50:58,672 --> 00:50:59,832
Gonna take a shower.

880
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,739
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

881
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,545
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

882
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,590
Who'd have thought that a random girl
from yoga...

883
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:25,664
...would fix me up with such a good kisser?
- Back at you, sister.

884
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:30,863
I can't wait to kiss you again.

885
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,097
But we're kissing right now.

886
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,433
I know, next time.

887
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:37,304
The second-date kiss
is way more intimate.

888
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:40,474
Well, listen...

889
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:44,139
...I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

890
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:49,520
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.

891
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,150
Okay.

892
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:10,534
Oh, yeah.

893
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,768
Yeah?

894
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,709
Hey, sorry to bug you again.
Quick question.

895
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,179
Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.

896
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,284
What's going on?

897
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:22,478
Okay, I'm making out with this guy--
PG stuff.

898
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:26,092
And he mentions that he's going
out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.

899
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:27,385
Run.

900
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,152
But maybe he is going out of town.

901
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,924
Where? Where's he going
that he's gonna be out of touch?

902
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:37,467
Where are you going
out of town to again?

903
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,901
Um-- Uh--
Pittsburgh.

904
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,601
Pittsburgh.

905
00:52:42,776 --> 00:52:43,902
Run.

906
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:47,513
So, what, now I'm just supposed to run
from every guy who doesn't like me?

907
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:49,775
Yeah.

908
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,278
There's not gonna be anybody left.

909
00:52:54,354 --> 00:52:56,584
I don't know why I'm saying this...

910
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,589
...but I think I know a nice guy
who might actually like you.

911
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,454
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

912
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,721
<i>He's friends with my brother.</i>
<i>His name's Bill.</i>

913
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:06,422
<i>We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.</i>

914
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,627
So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom
right now.

915
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:11,828
<i>What do I do?</i>

916
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:16,135
Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
But I'd take my time in there.

917
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:18,373
<i>I'd let him sweat.</i>

918
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,809
- Thanks.
- <i>Good luck.</i>

919
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:52,640
Yeah,
the boat looks great.

920
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,336
You look like shit.

921
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:56,414
But your boat looks great.

922
00:53:56,583 --> 00:54:00,383
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.

923
00:54:00,553 --> 00:54:02,680
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

924
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:05,120
A lot of time to work on the place.

925
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:07,123
You should try
working on a shower.

926
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:08,886
Yeah.

927
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:12,255
Hey, what can I tell you?

928
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:16,368
Standing on principle, man. It's all I got.

929
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,997
Cigarette?

930
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,369
No, I'm good.

931
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,875
That's right, you quit.

932
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,503
Good for you.

933
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:38,751
So did Janine send you out here
to check up on me?

934
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,189
Yeah, pretty much.

935
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,226
What are you gonna tell her?

936
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,227
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look
out here on the ocean.

937
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,559
Break.

938
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:52,534
Any word from Beth?

939
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,476
She's so busy organizing
her sister's funeral, I think she must be--

940
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:58,736
Sister's what?

941
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:00,903
Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.

942
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,709
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said "funeral."

943
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,441
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

944
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,245
Shit, did I really?

945
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,615
That's so weird.

946
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,286
I don't understand
why people wanna get married.

947
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:15,419
They don't.

948
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,119
- They don't?
- No.

949
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:20,656
No, no guy actually wants to get married.

950
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:24,031
And if they do,
all they're really thinking about?

951
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:26,399
All the women
they're gonna miss out on.

952
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,768
I don't wanna be with anybody else,
just Beth.

953
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:32,508
I don't know, man, I...

954
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:34,340
Why'd you get married?

955
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,483
I love Janine.

956
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:40,278
You're a happily married guy.

957
00:55:41,054 --> 00:55:42,749
Yeah.

958
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,947
Yeah, I'd say so.

959
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:53,625
Now, I know I don't need
to tell any of you...

960
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,463
...that my cousin Paige is hot.

961
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,570
In high school, if I told the popular guys
that Paige was my cousin...

962
00:56:02,742 --> 00:56:04,801
...it'd keep me
from getting my ass kicked...

963
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:07,708
...because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her.

964
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,946
And when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to Devon...

965
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,816
...there will be hearts breaking
all over the world.

966
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,855
- Hear, hear.
- That's sweet.

967
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:25,663
But, you know, keep in mind
that her sister Beth is still on the market.

968
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,563
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...

969
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:32,466
...but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank.

970
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,368
But don't stay on the lot too long...

971
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,476
...or next year's models are gonna
slip in there and steal all--

972
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,635
Okay, that's enough of the speeches.

973
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,837
Okay.

974
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,914
So enjoy the crab.

975
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:48,817
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,
it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

976
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:53,721
Bethie.

977
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:57,961
Your cousin Jay
has always been a jackass.

978
00:56:58,131 --> 00:56:59,155
I know.

979
00:56:59,632 --> 00:57:01,896
And somehow even he's married.

980
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:05,734
Oh, honey, look.

981
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:09,363
Back when everyone
was just going to camp at the Y...

982
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:11,533
...you borrowed my <i>New York Times</i>...

983
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:14,077
...found some arts camp
in the Berkshires...

984
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:17,410
...wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own.

985
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:20,246
You never did things like everyone else.

986
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,717
Why not?

987
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:23,412
Because that's you.

988
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:26,790
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

989
00:57:27,393 --> 00:57:29,861
You're not supposed to say that.

990
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,860
I don't give a shit.

991
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,556
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

992
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,725
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

993
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:39,667
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

994
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,704
It's true, though.

995
00:57:59,025 --> 00:58:00,049
Hey.

996
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,159
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

997
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,732
Come on.

998
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,131
Sorry I'm late.

999
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:16,639
No, it's okay.

1000
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:18,743
I like a little time before a blind date.

1001
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,609
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

1002
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:24,010
Gigi, he's not coming.

1003
00:58:24,184 --> 00:58:27,381
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1004
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:29,317
Hey.

1005
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:31,184
How could he already not like me?

1006
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:34,588
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1007
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,160
Hi. Are you good?

1008
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:38,422
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

1009
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:44,637
Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1010
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:48,900
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1011
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:50,542
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.

1012
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,177
Oh, God, no.

1013
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:54,574
How do you know?

1014
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:57,282
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1015
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,782
She's interested, he's clearly not.

1016
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,945
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

1017
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,784
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

1018
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,519
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

1019
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:10,959
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here."

1020
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,529
And look, how fortuitous.

1021
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:15,361
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

1022
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,799
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

1023
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:20,902
Man, you have a gift.

1024
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,167
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

1025
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:27,370
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1026
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:29,674
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1027
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:32,682
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

1028
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:34,444
- Really?
- Bullshit.

1029
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:35,952
Enlighten me.

1030
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:37,783
Guys invented the spark...

1031
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:41,791
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

1032
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:45,692
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

1033
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:47,457
...was actually just a spark.

1034
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:50,831
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

1035
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,201
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

1036
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:55,398
I don't.

1037
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:58,908
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

1038
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:00,978
...because secretly you love the drama...

1039
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:03,615
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

1040
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,915
Maybe.

1041
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:07,677
And let me guess:

1042
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,084
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

1043
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:12,417
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

1044
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:15,823
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

1045
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:18,486
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

1046
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,501
Okay. Yeah.

1047
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,331
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

1048
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:28,338
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

1049
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:31,705
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

1050
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,903
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

1051
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,905
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

1052
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,712
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

1053
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,718
I don't know, I like you.

1054
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:45,047
You do?

1055
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,721
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1056
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,924
I just mean-- I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1057
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:57,899
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

1058
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,096
Again with the sensitivity.

1059
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:02,299
To sensitivity.

1060
01:01:09,653 --> 01:01:11,416
It looks good.

1061
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:13,021
Yeah.

1062
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,714
Yeah.

1063
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:18,322
- He does good work.
- Yeah, he does.

1064
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:22,126
Very nice.

1065
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:27,832
Very nice.

1066
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:33,267
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1067
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:36,411
Javier...

1068
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,844
...if I asked you an honest question...

1069
01:01:40,016 --> 01:01:42,450
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

1070
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:45,588
- I think so.
- Good, good.

1071
01:01:46,122 --> 01:01:50,024
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

1072
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:52,528
Javier?

1073
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,493
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1074
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:57,224
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

1075
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,834
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1076
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:01,334
Javier...

1077
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,867
...have you guys been smoking...

1078
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:05,806
...or not?

1079
01:02:07,544 --> 01:02:11,207
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

1080
01:02:11,748 --> 01:02:13,909
Are you sure your guys haven't been...

1081
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:16,416
...sneaking around here?

1082
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:17,644
And smoking?

1083
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:20,815
And lying to me?

1084
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:22,253
And smoking?

1085
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:23,483
I'm pretty sure.

1086
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,094
I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

1087
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:28,629
Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

1088
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,234
To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

1089
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:34,167
That's a lot of prepositions.

1090
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:39,001
I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

1091
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:42,508
I mean, we made promises to each other.

1092
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,839
I mean, we have a contract.

1093
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:49,008
That's like making promises. Isn't it?

1094
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:52,950
Maybe I should get back to work.

1095
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:57,417
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

1096
01:02:57,594 --> 01:02:59,960
That's great, yeah.

1097
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,792
- Javier?
- Yeah.

1098
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:06,258
We're good. Right? You and me.

1099
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:09,435
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.
- Oh, good.

1100
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:11,439
Okay, that's great.

1101
01:03:11,608 --> 01:03:13,633
Yeah, he did great work.

1102
01:03:19,015 --> 01:03:20,448
Hey.

1103
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:24,583
Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming. I'm Conor.

1104
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:27,279
Sign in when you get a second.
Make yourselves at home.

1105
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:30,654
We got some cookies over here,
some cold beverages. Help yourself.

1106
01:03:30,827 --> 01:03:33,387
Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli
of real estate.

1107
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:37,329
- I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
- I know, she's so great.

1108
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:41,959
Well, I gotta go,
so I guess I'll see you later.

1109
01:03:42,138 --> 01:03:43,469
What, you got a class, or?

1110
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,007
Yeah. No. No, just something.

1111
01:03:47,177 --> 01:03:49,611
- Stuff I gotta do.
- Okay. Well...

1112
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:52,748
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

1113
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,180
Okay. Bye.

1114
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:57,252
- See you later.
- All right. Call me.

1115
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:02,648
What?

1116
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,452
She's holding out on you, isn't she?

1117
01:04:08,298 --> 01:04:10,266
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1118
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:12,526
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1119
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:16,095
It's written all over
your puppy-dog face.

1120
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:20,643
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

1121
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,243
No, I'm cool.

1122
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:25,074
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

1123
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:27,113
We used to sleep together all the time.

1124
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:32,180
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

1125
01:04:32,355 --> 01:04:35,847
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

1126
01:04:36,025 --> 01:04:38,858
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

1127
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:42,225
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

1128
01:04:42,399 --> 01:04:44,890
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

1129
01:04:45,068 --> 01:04:48,003
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

1130
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:51,140
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

1131
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:54,071
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

1132
01:04:54,244 --> 01:04:57,975
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you."

1133
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:01,576
One, two, three.

1134
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:04,083
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

1135
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:06,882
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you."

1136
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:08,580
One, two...

1137
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:11,420
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

1138
01:05:12,796 --> 01:05:14,696
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

1139
01:05:14,864 --> 01:05:16,729
All right, well,
I can tell you this:

1140
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,892
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

1141
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:23,368
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

1142
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,603
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

1143
01:05:28,778 --> 01:05:31,178
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

1144
01:05:34,617 --> 01:05:36,551
<i>If a girl's into you,</i>
<i>she's sleeping with you.</i>

1145
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:40,185
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

1146
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:42,415
...she's not sleeping with you?

1147
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:44,924
She doesn't like you.

1148
01:05:45,395 --> 01:05:47,192
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1149
01:05:47,363 --> 01:05:51,299
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1150
01:05:51,468 --> 01:05:55,302
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

1151
01:05:56,506 --> 01:05:58,804
A girl will never sleep with you...

1152
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:02,035
...if she calls you "cuddly"
or "dependable."

1153
01:06:02,378 --> 01:06:04,369
If she pops a zit in front of you...

1154
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:08,077
...if her name is Amber or Christine...

1155
01:06:08,485 --> 01:06:10,453
...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

1156
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:14,215
...or she takes home leftovers
on dates one, two, or three.

1157
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,858
I know it's not scientific...

1158
01:06:17,026 --> 01:06:19,290
...but I'm just saying,
you were warned.

1159
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:42,508
Wait, stop.

1160
01:06:45,788 --> 01:06:46,812
What?

1161
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:49,253
Shit.

1162
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:51,083
What?

1163
01:06:53,563 --> 01:06:55,121
I am so into you.

1164
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,158
Seriously, I've never felt like this before.

1165
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:01,993
I have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you.

1166
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:04,666
Like, all the time.

1167
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:09,610
Why stop?

1168
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:14,774
Because I don't do stuff like this.

1169
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:16,816
Stuff like what?

1170
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,621
Like sleep with women
that aren't my wife.

1171
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:25,193
First of all, I am not "women,"
I'm just one.

1172
01:07:25,862 --> 01:07:27,227
And second of all?

1173
01:07:28,932 --> 01:07:30,524
Oh, I didn't have a second of all.

1174
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,498
I was hoping "second of all"
would make me feel better.

1175
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:40,165
Second of all...

1176
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:44,204
...I can't stop thinking about you either.

1177
01:07:56,793 --> 01:08:00,058
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.

1178
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:02,322
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

1179
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:04,557
I don't know. I mean, look at Becca.

1180
01:08:04,734 --> 01:08:06,361
You know, my sister's friend.

1181
01:08:06,536 --> 01:08:08,265
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

1182
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:11,737
...and by the end of the meal,
they both knew they had found the one.

1183
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:16,370
You're right. You're totally right.
I mean, it could happen, right?

1184
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:18,711
Not for me.

1185
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,581
What about texter?

1186
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,446
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

1187
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:27,579
I mean, this guy could've had surgery,
leaving him without a voice box...

1188
01:08:27,757 --> 01:08:29,224
...breathing through a stoma...

1189
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:32,850
...and I would never know because
I've never actually heard his voice.

1190
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,963
Well, I doubt he has a stoma.

1191
01:08:35,131 --> 01:08:38,191
That's not the point.
I can't text.

1192
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,529
You know, I'm not charming via text.

1193
01:08:40,703 --> 01:08:42,330
Maybe you should
just stop texting.

1194
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:47,465
But it's not just texting, it's e-mail.
It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

1195
01:08:47,644 --> 01:08:48,736
That's regular mail.

1196
01:08:48,911 --> 01:08:50,640
Whatever. None of it's working.

1197
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:55,807
I had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work, so I called him at home.

1198
01:08:55,985 --> 01:09:00,422
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

1199
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:05,527
Then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control.

1200
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:10,962
And I miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine.

1201
01:09:11,134 --> 01:09:13,898
And that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape...

1202
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:17,733
...and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didn't.

1203
01:09:17,907 --> 01:09:21,104
And now you have to go around
checking all these different portals...

1204
01:09:21,277 --> 01:09:24,337
...just to get rejected
by seven different technologies.

1205
01:09:24,514 --> 01:09:26,345
It's exhausting.

1206
01:09:26,816 --> 01:09:28,977
What about that MySpace guy?

1207
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:31,712
- Jude. I like him.
- Good.

1208
01:09:32,321 --> 01:09:34,789
Yeah, I felt like we connected.

1209
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:36,254
Great.

1210
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:39,290
<i>What if she wants you to kiss her?</i>

1211
01:09:39,462 --> 01:09:43,159
<i>Well, then I guess</i>
<i>I'm just gonna have to kiss her.</i>

1212
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:45,095
"Amanda Jones
is no minor leaguer...

1213
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,294
...who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips."

1214
01:09:49,772 --> 01:09:51,672
<i>This babe has
plenty of battle scars.</i>

1215
01:09:52,141 --> 01:09:53,165
Hello?

1216
01:09:54,477 --> 01:09:55,842
Oh, hey, you're home.

1217
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:58,344
Where am I supposed to be?

1218
01:09:59,082 --> 01:10:01,448
Out, maybe? It's Saturday night.

1219
01:10:01,884 --> 01:10:05,342
You won't let me go out with guys
who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

1220
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:07,785
Right. Listen, I was just gonna
leave a message.

1221
01:10:07,957 --> 01:10:10,448
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.

1222
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:15,130
Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
Might be kind of awkward.

1223
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:19,234
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C.
But there'll be a lot of single guys.

1224
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:21,962
So there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward.

1225
01:10:22,138 --> 01:10:24,629
Don't worry, I'll be there.
I'll talk you through it.

1226
01:10:25,975 --> 01:10:27,067
Okay, gotta go.

1227
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:30,303
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates.
Maybe I'll see you there.

1228
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,914
You're busy. I shouldn't have called.
You called me.

1229
01:10:33,082 --> 01:10:35,141
- <i>Yup, good.</i>
- Bye.

1230
01:10:38,988 --> 01:10:41,718
<i>How--How do you work on it?</i>

1231
01:10:42,358 --> 01:10:44,986
<i>Pretend I'm a girl, okay?</i>

1232
01:10:46,195 --> 01:10:47,685
<i>I mean...</i>

1233
01:10:48,197 --> 01:10:49,391
<i>... pretend I'm her.</i>

1234
01:10:50,299 --> 01:10:51,960
<i>Amanda.</i>

1235
01:10:55,204 --> 01:10:56,466
He's into me.

1236
01:10:56,639 --> 01:10:58,800
Awesome. I knew it.

1237
01:10:58,975 --> 01:11:00,909
- Who's this now?
- Alex.

1238
01:11:01,077 --> 01:11:04,342
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

1239
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:07,677
- He's what?
- From <i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i>.

1240
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,875
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson
was Watts.

1241
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:12,282
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?

1242
01:11:12,889 --> 01:11:14,447
I'm Eric Stoltz.

1243
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:19,090
Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones.

1244
01:11:19,262 --> 01:11:21,127
Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

1245
01:11:21,798 --> 01:11:23,959
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

1246
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:28,702
I guess. At first. Now men in general,
but that's not the point.

1247
01:11:28,871 --> 01:11:30,736
The point is he's into me.

1248
01:11:30,907 --> 01:11:34,365
I knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you.

1249
01:11:34,544 --> 01:11:38,105
I know. It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.

1250
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:41,739
Signs. Love signs. You gotta
tell me about the signs. I love signs.

1251
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:45,854
First they were small. At first when I
called, he said, "Good to hear from you."

1252
01:11:46,022 --> 01:11:47,455
- Totally good sign.
- Right?

1253
01:11:47,623 --> 01:11:50,251
And then the next time I called
he was with a woman...

1254
01:11:50,426 --> 01:11:53,122
...but he took the call
and we talked for a while.

1255
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:55,355
- You know it was a woman?
- Called her "babe."

1256
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:59,467
Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he's...

1257
01:11:59,635 --> 01:12:00,966
And it gets more obvious.

1258
01:12:01,137 --> 01:12:05,130
I mean, please. There was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with.

1259
01:12:05,308 --> 01:12:06,775
The fix-up was him.

1260
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:08,069
No.

1261
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:12,180
Yes. He shows up
without this fictitious Bill character.

1262
01:12:12,348 --> 01:12:14,077
The two of us basically have a date.

1263
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:19,187
And then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place.

1264
01:12:19,355 --> 01:12:21,755
He so likes you.

1265
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:25,488
I'm so happy for you.

1266
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:28,596
Let's look up places
for your destination wedding.

1267
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:34,695
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

1268
01:12:34,871 --> 01:12:37,032
I have really always wanted to go there.

1269
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:41,769
Oh, he's cute.

1270
01:12:41,944 --> 01:12:44,378
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

1271
01:12:45,147 --> 01:12:49,481
Oh. "All I have is my guitar, these chords,
and the truth."

1272
01:12:49,652 --> 01:12:50,846
Bon Jovi.

1273
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,420
- That's hot.
- Yeah. I like him.

1274
01:12:53,589 --> 01:12:57,650
I mean, he probably hasn't called yet
because we just had coffee last night.

1275
01:12:58,194 --> 01:12:59,991
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

1276
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:03,393
I mean, we actually video
iChatted while holding coffee.

1277
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:05,227
But that's the same thing, right?

1278
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:07,528
- Right, right.
- Just call your voicemail.

1279
01:13:07,703 --> 01:13:11,571
Yeah, but he had a gig last night
and he probably didn't get home till late.

1280
01:13:11,741 --> 01:13:13,709
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.

1281
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:15,639
- Just call.
- Oh, honey, no, on speaker.

1282
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:18,543
I don't think so.
I'm sure he hasn't called.

1283
01:13:18,714 --> 01:13:20,238
- Just call him.
- Okay.

1284
01:13:25,988 --> 01:13:29,446
- <i>You have two new messages.</i>
- Oh.

1285
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:33,262
<i>Mary</i>

1286
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:37,297
<i>Whoa, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary</i>

1287
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:40,802
<i>Oh, my Mary</i>

1288
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:43,003
I just got hard.

1289
01:13:43,172 --> 01:13:44,662
<i>Hey, Mary, it's Jude.</i>

1290
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,776
<i>I was just calling to tell you again</i>
<i>how special it was to meet you.</i>

1291
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:52,506
<i>So call me back.
Bye-bye.</i>

1292
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,677
Amazing.

1293
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,312
- This is good, this is good.
- This is...

1294
01:13:58,487 --> 01:13:59,715
See, he called.

1295
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:01,584
<i>Jenny</i>

1296
01:14:01,757 --> 01:14:05,693
<i>Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny</i>

1297
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:09,058
<i>Hey, Jenny, it's Jude.</i>
<i>I was just calling to--</i>

1298
01:14:09,231 --> 01:14:13,258
<i>Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?</i>

1299
01:14:13,469 --> 01:14:16,461
<i>All messages erased.</i>

1300
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:28,941
That one.

1301
01:14:29,118 --> 01:14:30,210
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1302
01:14:31,754 --> 01:14:33,813
No. It's a laminate.

1303
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:37,258
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.

1304
01:14:37,426 --> 01:14:40,918
It looks exactly like it. But it is
like one one-hundredth of the cost.

1305
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:42,291
Oh.

1306
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:45,629
I still wanna go with the real wood.

1307
01:14:46,435 --> 01:14:48,733
What? You can't even tell the difference.

1308
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:50,633
It's not the point.

1309
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:53,005
Well, what is the point?

1310
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:54,870
I just...

1311
01:14:55,344 --> 01:14:58,040
I don't like the way
it's pretending to be wood.

1312
01:14:58,214 --> 01:15:00,808
If you're not wood,
don't try and look like wood.

1313
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,643
I don't think that it's pretending.

1314
01:15:04,854 --> 01:15:06,515
This is a lie, Ben.

1315
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:10,318
Just be up front
and tell people what you really are.

1316
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:14,256
Okay, you're right. You're right.

1317
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,057
I'm sorry.

1318
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:22,495
It's okay. Maybe we should just go
look at the grills and we'll come back.

1319
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:24,463
Okay.

1320
01:15:29,011 --> 01:15:30,979
I slept with someone.

1321
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:41,683
- I said--
- I heard you.

1322
01:15:46,028 --> 01:15:49,259
You tell me this in Home Depot
because you know I hate a public scene.

1323
01:15:49,432 --> 01:15:52,128
No, that is not why I'm telling--

1324
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:54,227
I knew it.

1325
01:15:55,137 --> 01:15:56,161
I knew it.

1326
01:15:56,338 --> 01:15:58,238
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.

1327
01:16:00,242 --> 01:16:03,177
It is you that's been smoking too,
isn't it?

1328
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:06,247
Wha--? Wait, what does that
even matter?

1329
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:08,110
Have you--?!

1330
01:16:09,485 --> 01:16:11,009
Have you been smoking?

1331
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:12,518
No. No, I haven't.

1332
01:16:19,795 --> 01:16:21,092
I talked to Neil. I told him.

1333
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,060
He said I could stay
at his boat for a while.

1334
01:16:23,232 --> 01:16:24,529
Excuse me?

1335
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,761
Now you're moving out?

1336
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:29,837
- You're, like, leaving me?
- No.

1337
01:16:30,005 --> 01:16:33,202
No, I just assumed
that you wouldn't want me to--

1338
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:37,939
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

1339
01:16:38,114 --> 01:16:42,073
Don't you wanna find some way...

1340
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:44,879
...for us to work through this?

1341
01:16:45,387 --> 01:16:49,289
I assumed that when I told you,
you would want me...

1342
01:16:50,192 --> 01:16:51,216
...out.

1343
01:16:53,963 --> 01:16:55,692
Is that what you want?

1344
01:17:08,978 --> 01:17:10,240
No.

1345
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:14,046
Okay.

1346
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,917
Okay.

1347
01:17:38,974 --> 01:17:41,465
You're doing a great job.

1348
01:17:48,484 --> 01:17:51,351
Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget. Hi!

1349
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,955
Oh, my goodness.

1350
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:02,696
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

1351
01:18:12,274 --> 01:18:16,267
Seriously, Devon, I really did feel
just a moment, a splash, of hesitation.

1352
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:18,777
No, there wasn't.
There wasn't any hesitation at all.

1353
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:21,007
You just did it again.
That was a pause.

1354
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,447
I did not pause.

1355
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:31,757
You must be Beth.

1356
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:36,255
Yeah. Yeah.

1357
01:18:36,432 --> 01:18:38,730
Heard a lot about you from Paige.

1358
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:43,169
Actually been lobbying
to sit next to her single sister for weeks.

1359
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:45,639
Oh, yeah?

1360
01:18:45,808 --> 01:18:48,276
So you must be:

1361
01:18:48,444 --> 01:18:50,071
"Dan."

1362
01:18:50,613 --> 01:18:52,046
Sort of.

1363
01:18:53,015 --> 01:18:56,280
- Sort of?
- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan.

1364
01:18:56,452 --> 01:18:58,147
- A what?
- A Wiccan.

1365
01:18:58,887 --> 01:18:59,911
Wiccan?

1366
01:19:00,089 --> 01:19:01,647
- Male witch.
- Right.

1367
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:04,384
So I also have a magical name.

1368
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,058
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.

1369
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:10,596
But I didn't know if that would fit
on the card. Love that.

1370
01:19:10,766 --> 01:19:13,394
I'm guessing that I'm gonna
hear a whole lot about you.

1371
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:16,060
Nature-based
pre-Christian paganism, yeah.

1372
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:18,229
Yeah. That's fantastic.

1373
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:19,840
Well, where to begin?

1374
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:23,001
Well, first off, it's not just a bunch
of nude farming. Dad.

1375
01:19:23,178 --> 01:19:25,203
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.

1376
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:26,678
Obviously not a coincidence.

1377
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:29,647
They didn't have the machinery
to move those rocks. They're huge.

1378
01:19:29,818 --> 01:19:30,807
- Yeah, they're heavy.
- Of course.

1379
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:04,140
- I'm Nathan. And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.

1380
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:06,811
- Gigi. Hi.
- Hey.

1381
01:20:07,821 --> 01:20:11,222
So how do you guys know Alex?

1382
01:20:12,493 --> 01:20:16,122
We don't. Our friend Mary heard
about this from some guy named Conor.

1383
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:21,360
And how do you know Alex?

1384
01:20:23,237 --> 01:20:24,864
I hope--

1385
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:28,697
I'm pretty sure that something's
about to happen between us.

1386
01:20:28,876 --> 01:20:30,400
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1387
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:34,343
So are you here as, like, a guest,
or, like, his date?

1388
01:20:34,515 --> 01:20:38,212
Oh, I hate that.
When you don't know if you're a date.

1389
01:20:38,385 --> 01:20:41,650
You don't know if you should bring
a friend, or are you co-hosting...

1390
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:44,518
...or should you stay to the end
to have some alone time?

1391
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:47,160
He didn't say.
I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

1392
01:20:48,095 --> 01:20:49,858
- I mean, there have been signs.
- Cool.

1393
01:21:16,156 --> 01:21:17,384
So where's Neil?

1394
01:21:17,558 --> 01:21:18,616
We broke up.

1395
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:21,022
- No way.
- Yeah.

1396
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:23,689
You guys were together,
what, like 10 years?

1397
01:21:23,864 --> 01:21:25,661
Seven. But still, it's a long time.

1398
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:26,959
Yeah.

1399
01:21:27,534 --> 01:21:30,435
It's too bad cousins can't marry,
because then we could maybe--

1400
01:21:30,604 --> 01:21:32,572
Oh, Dominic.

1401
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:34,965
- Gross.
- No.

1402
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,705
Ken, are you okay?
What happened?

1403
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:42,072
Oh, my God.

1404
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:44,513
- Ken, are you all right?
- Just clutched his chest.

1405
01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:46,653
He was standing there
and all of a sudden--

1406
01:21:47,121 --> 01:21:48,850
- Ken, just try to breathe.
- Call 911.

1407
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:50,148
Dad. Excuse me.

1408
01:21:50,324 --> 01:21:52,815
Daddy, what is it? What happened?
What happened?

1409
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:54,927
- Guys, come here!
- What happened?

1410
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:56,528
Daddy, lay down, okay?

1411
01:21:56,697 --> 01:21:58,028
- Did he fall?
- You'll be fine.

1412
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:01,065
You guys, did anybody
see what happened?

1413
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:03,760
- Over there. Just go get it.
- Okay.

1414
01:22:06,173 --> 01:22:08,437
Hey, hey. I had no idea
it'd be such a madhouse.

1415
01:22:08,609 --> 01:22:09,871
Hey. Great party.

1416
01:22:10,043 --> 01:22:12,443
Thanks. Did any guys hit on you?
A lot of them here.

1417
01:22:12,613 --> 01:22:15,207
You need me to evaluate
any level of interest?

1418
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:18,647
They were gay. Even I know
their level of interest was probably low.

1419
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:19,843
Hey, Skilo!

1420
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:23,217
It's too bad Bill couldn't make it.
I know you guys would hit it off.

1421
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:24,789
Okay, right. "Bill."

1422
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:26,950
Right.

1423
01:22:31,165 --> 01:22:35,534
Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run,
but the food needs some refreshing.

1424
01:22:36,303 --> 01:22:38,965
- Would you mind helping and refilling--?
- Like co-hosting?

1425
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,467
Okay, yeah.

1426
01:22:42,643 --> 01:22:43,667
Sure.

1427
01:22:43,844 --> 01:22:46,176
Just refilling the chips.
They're on the fridge.

1428
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:47,438
Thanks.

1429
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:54,118
- Hey, sweetie, get me a beer?
- I'll get you another.

1430
01:22:54,288 --> 01:22:56,756
- Hi, guys.
- Nice.

1431
01:22:56,924 --> 01:22:58,915
Hey, Linda.

1432
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:16,939
- Really great party.
- Oh, thanks.

1433
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:21,475
You know, when Alex said he wanted
to throw a party, I was like, "Let's do it!"

1434
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:24,446
- Thanks for having us.
- No problem, any time.

1435
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:26,684
Can I help you find something?

1436
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:28,913
Oh, no, it's okay. I got it.

1437
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:30,522
Thanks for mixing that up.

1438
01:23:31,358 --> 01:23:32,416
What?

1439
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:36,256
Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.

1440
01:23:37,531 --> 01:23:39,294
It could use a little more dill.

1441
01:23:39,466 --> 01:23:41,195
I'm on it, though, don't worry.

1442
01:23:45,372 --> 01:23:47,101
Come on, my boy. Take it home.

1443
01:23:47,274 --> 01:23:49,105
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

1444
01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:50,903
- Fifteen seconds.
- Let's go.

1445
01:23:51,078 --> 01:23:53,376
- Oh, a pass.
- You work too hard.

1446
01:23:53,547 --> 01:23:56,880
Well, I think I've rounded up
the last of the beer bottles.

1447
01:23:58,318 --> 01:24:01,310
- Oh, what game are we playing?
- Oh, sorry, Nash.

1448
01:24:01,488 --> 01:24:03,718
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, come on.

1449
01:24:03,891 --> 01:24:07,520
- Nash, you piece of shit. Come on.
- Maybe I should just--

1450
01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:09,423
- It's past 3, so...
- Okay, swat it.

1451
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:11,029
Watch this. Ready?

1452
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:12,756
- And...
- Oh, no, no, no!

1453
01:24:12,933 --> 01:24:16,130
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

1454
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:18,237
Oh, you are--
You're sensational.

1455
01:24:18,405 --> 01:24:19,463
- Yeah, I know.
- Jesus.

1456
01:24:20,173 --> 01:24:21,731
I don't know why I bother.

1457
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:23,877
- Did you say it's past 3?
- Yeah.

1458
01:24:24,044 --> 01:24:27,343
- Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game.
- All right.

1459
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:29,539
- Bye.
- Bye.

1460
01:24:52,539 --> 01:24:55,633
Hey, thanks for staying
and helping me clean up.

1461
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:58,771
I really gotta go to bed, though.

1462
01:24:58,946 --> 01:25:00,436
Is that an invitation?

1463
01:25:01,315 --> 01:25:02,339
What?

1464
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,911
Oh, God, that was cheesy.

1465
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:08,844
Oh, I'm not good at this.

1466
01:25:09,289 --> 01:25:10,415
What?

1467
01:25:19,466 --> 01:25:20,728
Hey.

1468
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:23,329
Oh, yes. I knew it.

1469
01:25:23,503 --> 01:25:26,563
The best relationships
grow out of friendships.

1470
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,799
Wait, wait, wait. Gigi.

1471
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:31,638
Wait, wait, wait.

1472
01:25:31,812 --> 01:25:33,109
What?

1473
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,111
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1474
01:25:35,282 --> 01:25:39,184
Well, I'd say if we're not
at relationship station-ship...

1475
01:25:39,353 --> 01:25:40,820
...we're at least on the track.

1476
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:45,214
And why exactly would you think that?

1477
01:25:45,392 --> 01:25:47,155
Because of the signs.

1478
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:49,093
Really, like what?

1479
01:25:49,262 --> 01:25:52,493
Like, it was good to hear from me...

1480
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:56,033
...and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl...

1481
01:25:56,203 --> 01:25:58,899
...and I felt something.

1482
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:01,373
Oh, man.

1483
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:02,803
What are you talking about?

1484
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:06,275
Gigi, what have I been saying
since I met you?

1485
01:26:06,446 --> 01:26:10,109
If a guy wants to date you, he will make
it happen, okay? He will ask you out.

1486
01:26:10,283 --> 01:26:11,477
Did I ask you out?

1487
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:13,845
No.

1488
01:26:14,021 --> 01:26:16,546
Why would you do this?

1489
01:26:16,857 --> 01:26:18,825
Oh, shit.

1490
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:21,688
Why do women do this?
Build up this stuff in their minds...

1491
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:25,730
...take each little thing a guy does,
and then twist it into something else?

1492
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:27,594
It's insane.

1493
01:26:37,978 --> 01:26:41,038
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1494
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,378
Excuse me?

1495
01:26:44,551 --> 01:26:46,519
What is that supposed to mean?

1496
01:26:48,889 --> 01:26:51,585
I may dissect each little thing...

1497
01:26:51,758 --> 01:26:54,818
...and put myself out there too much...

1498
01:26:54,995 --> 01:26:57,327
...but at least that means I still care.

1499
01:26:57,497 --> 01:27:03,367
Oh, you think you've won
because women are expendable to you?

1500
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:07,871
You may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way...

1501
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,737
...but you don't fall in love
that way either.

1502
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:12,640
You have not won.

1503
01:27:12,813 --> 01:27:14,974
You're alone, Alex.

1504
01:27:21,721 --> 01:27:24,087
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

1505
01:27:24,257 --> 01:27:28,751
...but I know I'm a lot closer
to finding someone than you are.

1506
01:27:36,803 --> 01:27:38,930
Do you want anything else?

1507
01:27:39,106 --> 01:27:42,564
Yeah, less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food.

1508
01:27:42,742 --> 01:27:47,338
Well, that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1509
01:27:47,747 --> 01:27:51,239
Well, maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links.

1510
01:27:51,418 --> 01:27:54,546
People who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised...

1511
01:27:54,721 --> 01:27:58,179
...to have animal fat that's been stuffed
into a synthetic casing.

1512
01:28:08,902 --> 01:28:12,565
Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen, okay?

1513
01:28:12,739 --> 01:28:15,572
And a little plate of cold cuts,
if there are any left.

1514
01:28:15,742 --> 01:28:19,269
Hey, would you guys please just turn
that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

1515
01:28:19,446 --> 01:28:21,437
You think he wants
to hang on to this vinyl?

1516
01:28:21,615 --> 01:28:23,640
My collection could use a lot of these.

1517
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:26,149
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

1518
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:31,913
Well, we're totally out of toilet paper...

1519
01:28:32,092 --> 01:28:36,722
...and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

1520
01:28:36,897 --> 01:28:41,561
And our new brother would like to co-opt
Dad's property before he's even dead.

1521
01:28:41,735 --> 01:28:44,863
Laura, also your husband would
really like another beer...

1522
01:28:45,038 --> 01:28:48,166
...to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network.

1523
01:28:50,143 --> 01:28:51,735
Are you okay?

1524
01:28:53,213 --> 01:28:55,909
Don't worry, honey,
Dad's gonna be fine.

1525
01:28:57,617 --> 01:28:59,175
- Do you know who it is?
- No.

1526
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:02,352
Doesn't matter.

1527
01:29:03,723 --> 01:29:05,190
So are you gonna leave him?

1528
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:09,319
Gigi, he's my husband.

1529
01:29:09,496 --> 01:29:12,659
He's not some guy
who didn't call me back.

1530
01:29:12,832 --> 01:29:14,766
He did admit it to me.

1531
01:29:15,135 --> 01:29:18,627
He didn't wait to get caught,
which takes courage, you know?

1532
01:29:19,573 --> 01:29:21,939
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

1533
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:23,370
I didn't mean it.

1534
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:25,977
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

1535
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:28,337
Oh, it's okay.

1536
01:29:32,385 --> 01:29:33,716
It's my fault, you know.

1537
01:29:34,221 --> 01:29:35,279
What?

1538
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:41,724
Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole...

1539
01:29:41,895 --> 01:29:44,455
...mess. You know?

1540
01:29:44,631 --> 01:29:47,395
I forced him into getting married.

1541
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,997
- You know, he wasn't ready.
- Janine, this isn't your fault.

1542
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:54,197
No, it is. It is, I've changed.

1543
01:29:54,975 --> 01:29:56,738
I was...

1544
01:29:57,777 --> 01:29:59,904
...fun, you know?

1545
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:02,110
I was fun when we first met.

1546
01:30:02,282 --> 01:30:03,408
You're still fun.

1547
01:30:12,192 --> 01:30:13,591
We don't have sex anymore.

1548
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:21,163
Lots of couples go through lulls.

1549
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:22,824
No, I mean...

1550
01:30:25,272 --> 01:30:28,139
...we never have sex.

1551
01:30:36,049 --> 01:30:39,075
I mean, realistically,
what do I expect him to do, you know?

1552
01:30:39,252 --> 01:30:41,550
I don't think that's really...

1553
01:30:43,323 --> 01:30:45,951
God, this tile is too small.

1554
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:48,060
I have to tell Javier.

1555
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:51,691
- What?
- This tile is too small.

1556
01:30:51,998 --> 01:30:55,832
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,
if anyone asks.

1557
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:07,441
Well, my first husband
was unimpressive.

1558
01:31:07,614 --> 01:31:10,412
I found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary...

1559
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,778
...when I came home early
from the Maldives.

1560
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:15,853
It was just so unoriginal.

1561
01:31:16,022 --> 01:31:18,388
Made me feel sorry for him.

1562
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:22,221
My second husband
was a pinch more creative.

1563
01:31:22,395 --> 01:31:24,192
Cheated on me with my sister...

1564
01:31:24,364 --> 01:31:29,427
...but made me believe that I was insane
for being suspicious.

1565
01:31:29,602 --> 01:31:33,060
So at least some mind games,
some intrigue.

1566
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:36,868
But my last husband, he was a gem.

1567
01:31:37,043 --> 01:31:39,944
He was a veritable master
at covering his tracks.

1568
01:31:40,113 --> 01:31:45,050
I mean, I pored over his phone records,
I intercepted his credit-card bills...

1569
01:31:45,218 --> 01:31:47,311
...I had him followed
on numerous occasions...

1570
01:31:47,487 --> 01:31:50,820
...and never found
a single shred of evidence.

1571
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:53,390
It wasn't until he died...

1572
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:58,759
...that I found out about the property
he owned with his Austrian mistress.

1573
01:31:58,932 --> 01:32:03,631
But the real master, I have to say, is me.

1574
01:32:03,803 --> 01:32:09,469
Three husbands, countless boyfriends,
I haven't been caught yet.

1575
01:32:09,809 --> 01:32:11,936
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1576
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:17,172
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't--
- Shh.

1577
01:32:23,123 --> 01:32:24,852
It's over there.

1578
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:30,122
Oh, my God.

1579
01:32:30,296 --> 01:32:32,059
He liked the demo. I can't believe it.

1580
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:33,290
It's unbelievable.

1581
01:32:33,466 --> 01:32:36,162
Did you hear when he said
that it was hauntingly beautiful?

1582
01:32:36,336 --> 01:32:38,327
Yeah, I was there. I was--

1583
01:32:38,505 --> 01:32:40,200
I was there, baby.

1584
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,469
Thank you.

1585
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:18,602
Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over
some offering statements. You gotta--

1586
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,647
You gotta come back later.

1587
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:24,441
It's not Dana.

1588
01:33:27,554 --> 01:33:28,578
Is that your--?

1589
01:33:29,589 --> 01:33:30,851
- Is that your--?
- Shh.

1590
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:32,925
Can you get in the closet?

1591
01:33:34,727 --> 01:33:36,285
- Get in the closet.
- What?

1592
01:33:36,463 --> 01:33:38,931
Just go in the closet for a second.
Just for a second.

1593
01:33:39,098 --> 01:33:40,122
Ben?

1594
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:46,132
I keep telling Dana
to get that damn lock fixed.

1595
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:49,674
- Why do you even bother locking it?
- What?

1596
01:33:49,843 --> 01:33:52,243
Why do you bother locking it?

1597
01:33:53,246 --> 01:33:56,340
Oh, you know I can't get any work done
if I don't.

1598
01:34:03,957 --> 01:34:06,482
- Hey.
- Hi.

1599
01:34:07,093 --> 01:34:09,561
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

1600
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:23,399
What are you doing?

1601
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:26,069
Sit down.

1602
01:34:26,346 --> 01:34:27,870
Okay.

1603
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:41,586
Hon?

1604
01:34:46,466 --> 01:34:47,524
What are you doing?

1605
01:34:48,001 --> 01:34:50,162
I don't know. I just thought...

1606
01:34:50,336 --> 01:34:51,963
...maybe we could--

1607
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:55,067
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

1608
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:57,232
Maybe if you just go
over there.

1609
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:59,674
Just trying to...

1610
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,311
...you know,
re-light the fire.

1611
01:35:02,482 --> 01:35:04,643
Oh, honey.

1612
01:35:04,817 --> 01:35:09,015
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.

1613
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,617
Look...

1614
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,424
...I'm really trying here.

1615
01:35:18,698 --> 01:35:21,826
Do you wanna save our marriage?

1616
01:35:26,773 --> 01:35:28,673
Of course.

1617
01:35:29,309 --> 01:35:30,833
Me too.

1618
01:35:55,034 --> 01:35:58,800
Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in
with the bussers when you can.

1619
01:35:58,972 --> 01:36:00,940
Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.

1620
01:36:01,608 --> 01:36:04,577
Hey, I been working here 18 months,
8 through 10.

1621
01:36:05,812 --> 01:36:07,780
Minor oversight.

1622
01:36:09,415 --> 01:36:12,316
Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then.

1623
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:15,943
Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago.

1624
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:19,180
Yeah, he quit.

1625
01:36:20,526 --> 01:36:23,461
Is there any reason
we're even having this meeting?

1626
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,790
Not really.

1627
01:36:24,964 --> 01:36:26,932
- No, not for me.
- Great. Good. Great.

1628
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,000
Meeting adjourned.

1629
01:36:29,168 --> 01:36:30,931
Back to work.

1630
01:36:35,508 --> 01:36:37,772
Hey, Kelli Ann.

1631
01:36:39,946 --> 01:36:41,573
Did I get any calls?

1632
01:36:41,748 --> 01:36:47,084
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no.
Not a lot of phone traffic.

1633
01:36:51,824 --> 01:36:54,054
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1634
01:36:54,727 --> 01:36:55,819
What's her name?

1635
01:36:57,697 --> 01:36:59,028
Who?

1636
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:00,597
The girl, Alex.

1637
01:37:01,234 --> 01:37:03,395
There's no girl.

1638
01:37:03,569 --> 01:37:05,002
You can't hide it, man.

1639
01:37:05,171 --> 01:37:08,572
I know strung out
and you are strung out.

1640
01:37:10,476 --> 01:37:13,036
Okay, please.

1641
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:15,171
This is amazing.

1642
01:37:15,715 --> 01:37:17,478
You can't focus, right?

1643
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:21,916
Jumping every time your phone rings,
checking your e-mail 100 times a day...

1644
01:37:22,088 --> 01:37:23,851
...wishing you could write songs.

1645
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:28,687
No, feeling the need to bring up her name
in random conversations.

1646
01:37:29,362 --> 01:37:33,162
It's always the same
and it has happened to you, my friend.

1647
01:37:36,969 --> 01:37:38,493
Shit.

1648
01:37:41,107 --> 01:37:42,472
Welcome to my world, asshole.

1649
01:37:44,644 --> 01:37:46,407
Let me get the door.

1650
01:37:50,049 --> 01:37:52,916
Sure I can't interest you
in a little beef and broccoli?

1651
01:37:53,086 --> 01:37:54,951
I gotta finish this stuff.

1652
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:56,554
Okay.

1653
01:37:58,057 --> 01:38:00,958
- Yeah. So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

1654
01:38:01,928 --> 01:38:03,589
I love you.

1655
01:38:04,097 --> 01:38:05,928
I love you too.

1656
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:13,001
- Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1657
01:38:21,447 --> 01:38:23,074
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.

1658
01:38:23,249 --> 01:38:26,013
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?

1659
01:38:26,185 --> 01:38:28,380
- You're the one I wanna be--
- Don't touch me!

1660
01:38:28,554 --> 01:38:30,954
You will never touch me again.

1661
01:38:36,129 --> 01:38:38,563
Dino, thanks again for letting me
pay over the phone.

1662
01:38:38,731 --> 01:38:42,792
I assure you this late-payment thing
will never happen again.

1663
01:38:42,969 --> 01:38:45,529
Yep, just trying to trim
some of the drama out of my life.

1664
01:38:46,873 --> 01:38:47,965
Oh, that's my other line.

1665
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:49,335
Okay, bye.

1666
01:38:49,509 --> 01:38:51,534
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Gigi?</i>

1667
01:38:51,711 --> 01:38:53,110
<i>This is Bill.</i>

1668
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:55,270
- Bill?
- <i>Alex's friend.</i>

1669
01:38:55,448 --> 01:38:59,544
<i>We were supposed to meet up</i>
<i>but Alex told me the wrong day.</i>

1670
01:39:00,253 --> 01:39:02,244
Bill, so you do exist.

1671
01:39:02,421 --> 01:39:03,752
<i>I do.</i>

1672
01:39:03,923 --> 01:39:07,984
<i>And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime</i>
<i>if you're still game.</i>

1673
01:39:09,095 --> 01:39:10,357
Yes.

1674
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:12,657
Sure, why not?

1675
01:39:20,506 --> 01:39:21,734
Hey.

1676
01:39:21,908 --> 01:39:24,001
Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1677
01:39:24,177 --> 01:39:26,577
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

1678
01:39:27,013 --> 01:39:28,810
See, why did you
just call me "sweetie"?

1679
01:39:28,981 --> 01:39:32,075
- We always call each other that.
- Why?

1680
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:35,243
All right, look,
I wanna say something, okay?

1681
01:39:35,421 --> 01:39:37,821
We call each other "sweetie"
all the time.

1682
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,754
And we fall asleep on the phone
after talking for hours.

1683
01:39:40,927 --> 01:39:44,294
I washed your hair for you after
you had shoulder surgery and everything.

1684
01:39:44,463 --> 01:39:45,828
And it's like we're together.

1685
01:39:45,998 --> 01:39:48,125
- I know that I've been--
- No, hold on a second.

1686
01:39:48,301 --> 01:39:50,132
Let me finish.

1687
01:39:50,303 --> 01:39:52,134
I think maybe this is my fault...

1688
01:39:52,305 --> 01:39:56,036
...because maybe I wasn't clear
about exactly what I want.

1689
01:39:56,209 --> 01:39:58,837
So let me--
Let me be clear.

1690
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:00,911
I love hanging out.

1691
01:40:01,247 --> 01:40:05,081
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just-- I want both.

1692
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,015
I don't know what happened
or why we stopped. I don't care.

1693
01:40:08,187 --> 01:40:09,620
Okay.

1694
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:12,448
- What?
- Okay.

1695
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:15,822
No, I'm talking about really doing this.
Like a full-on relationship.

1696
01:40:15,995 --> 01:40:17,485
Right.

1697
01:40:17,663 --> 01:40:18,994
With me.

1698
01:40:19,165 --> 01:40:20,564
Yeah.

1699
01:40:22,068 --> 01:40:23,933
A bunch of gay people
put you up to this?

1700
01:40:24,103 --> 01:40:25,900
Stop talking.

1701
01:40:44,891 --> 01:40:48,088
- Stay home. It's an end-around.
- No, no, it's not. He's still got it.

1702
01:40:48,261 --> 01:40:49,694
He's still got it.

1703
01:40:49,862 --> 01:40:52,456
- Shit.
- Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.

1704
01:40:52,632 --> 01:40:56,432
- Argh!
- That is so embarrassing.

1705
01:40:56,802 --> 01:40:57,826
What?

1706
01:40:59,105 --> 01:41:01,630
Did any of you guys have a chance
to get to the store?

1707
01:41:02,174 --> 01:41:04,369
Oh, yeah, no.
We're good, we got takeout.

1708
01:41:04,944 --> 01:41:07,139
No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f--

1709
01:41:07,313 --> 01:41:10,282
- All right, here we go.
- Come on, defense, wake up.

1710
01:41:11,884 --> 01:41:14,648
You have to be kidding me.

1711
01:41:27,934 --> 01:41:31,267
I just got a little bit more of this
I gotta finish.

1712
01:41:31,437 --> 01:41:33,598
There's some laundry
I'm gonna put away...

1713
01:41:33,773 --> 01:41:36,503
...then I had another load of clothes
in the dryer.

1714
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:40,240
I did get some of the food your dad likes,
but some healthy stuff too.

1715
01:41:40,413 --> 01:41:42,244
Just, you know.

1716
01:41:45,217 --> 01:41:47,310
It's gonna be okay.

1717
01:41:50,089 --> 01:41:51,215
It'll be okay.

1718
01:43:00,292 --> 01:43:02,419
Bend your knee a little bit more.
There you go.

1719
01:43:02,595 --> 01:43:04,722
Inhale, reverse warrior, look up.

1720
01:43:04,897 --> 01:43:05,989
Exhale.

1721
01:43:17,643 --> 01:43:20,510
<i>Hi, you've reached Ben's cell phone.</i>
<i>Please leave--</i>

1722
01:43:50,176 --> 01:43:53,441
You lying sack of shit!

1723
01:43:58,784 --> 01:44:00,445
Lying!

1724
01:44:00,619 --> 01:44:01,643
Sack!

1725
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:03,413
Shit!

1726
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:44,458
Okay.

1727
01:44:54,874 --> 01:44:56,739
<i>...or call my cell,
or try me at work...</i>

1728
01:44:56,909 --> 01:45:00,242
<i>... but definitely leave a message</i>
<i>here first. Thanks.</i>

1729
01:45:00,412 --> 01:45:03,711
Hey, Gigi, it's Alex.

1730
01:45:04,283 --> 01:45:06,080
How's it going?

1731
01:45:06,252 --> 01:45:08,152
Just wondering how you're doing.

1732
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:12,154
I haven't talked to you in a little while...

1733
01:45:12,324 --> 01:45:14,485
...and was just wondering
how you're doing.

1734
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:18,289
So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you.

1735
01:45:19,231 --> 01:45:21,290
Obviously.

1736
01:45:21,867 --> 01:45:23,767
But you're out, I guess.

1737
01:45:23,936 --> 01:45:27,633
So just call me sometime.

1738
01:45:27,806 --> 01:45:28,966
Or tonight.

1739
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:31,735
I'm around, I'll be--
Well, I'm in and around.

1740
01:45:32,444 --> 01:45:35,140
So that's enough for now.

1741
01:45:36,682 --> 01:45:38,377
It's Alex.

1742
01:45:38,551 --> 01:45:40,143
Okay.

1743
01:45:43,789 --> 01:45:44,813
Dude.

1744
01:45:45,925 --> 01:45:47,517
I know.

1745
01:46:06,478 --> 01:46:07,502
Hey.

1746
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,409
Hey.

1747
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:12,679
Welcome aboard.

1748
01:46:12,851 --> 01:46:14,011
Might I come aboard?

1749
01:46:14,186 --> 01:46:16,620
Yeah. You remember the boat.

1750
01:46:16,789 --> 01:46:19,314
Well, you know, I thought I did.

1751
01:46:19,491 --> 01:46:21,925
- Or, you know, little...
- But it's been a while.

1752
01:46:22,094 --> 01:46:26,360
You know that dock? Over there,
there's a boat that looks just like yours.

1753
01:46:26,532 --> 01:46:27,965
- Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.

1754
01:46:28,133 --> 01:46:30,499
- No, that's not my boat.
- It's definitely not.

1755
01:46:30,669 --> 01:46:34,105
But there's a very nice gentleman...

1756
01:46:34,273 --> 01:46:35,535
...living on the boat...

1757
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:38,836
...who invited me in
for a white-wine spritzer.

1758
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:40,137
Oh, good.

1759
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:44,305
Wasn't expecting visitors.

1760
01:46:44,483 --> 01:46:48,476
That's all right. I just wanted
to just come by and say thanks...

1761
01:46:48,654 --> 01:46:50,588
...for helping yesterday.

1762
01:46:50,756 --> 01:46:54,783
Beth, you know, I'm the same person.

1763
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,394
I would do anything for you.

1764
01:46:57,563 --> 01:46:59,997
I just can't give you...

1765
01:47:00,165 --> 01:47:01,894
I just can't give you what you want.

1766
01:47:02,067 --> 01:47:03,864
You're what I want.

1767
01:47:04,036 --> 01:47:07,164
Our life together is what I want.

1768
01:47:07,339 --> 01:47:08,431
I miss it.

1769
01:47:08,607 --> 01:47:09,904
I miss you.

1770
01:47:10,075 --> 01:47:12,600
You see those guys my sisters
are married to--

1771
01:47:12,778 --> 01:47:15,338
You're more of a husband to me,
not being married...

1772
01:47:15,514 --> 01:47:18,972
...than those real husbands
are ever gonna be, and...

1773
01:47:19,151 --> 01:47:23,247
It's enough. It's really enough for me.

1774
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:28,091
And you would be willing...

1775
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:32,754
...to take the whole marriage thing
off the table completely?

1776
01:47:32,931 --> 01:47:36,890
If you promise to commit to me
and to love me, and--

1777
01:47:37,069 --> 01:47:39,196
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.

1778
01:47:39,872 --> 01:47:41,464
Okay. All right.

1779
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,167
- But I've loved you for seven years--
- Ah-ah.

1780
01:47:45,344 --> 01:47:46,902
Okay.

1781
01:47:48,113 --> 01:47:51,981
You have to snake the drain
when my hair gets clogged.

1782
01:47:52,151 --> 01:47:54,119
You know that happens. Okay?

1783
01:47:54,286 --> 01:47:55,719
Okay. Yeah.

1784
01:47:55,888 --> 01:47:57,617
And also...

1785
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:03,250
...you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins
in bed. You gotta give me that.

1786
01:48:03,429 --> 01:48:05,420
- Okay, fine. All right.
- Okay?

1787
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:08,394
And...

1788
01:48:08,967 --> 01:48:10,298
- Yeah.
- And?

1789
01:48:10,469 --> 01:48:12,937
- That's it.
- Okay.

1790
01:48:16,842 --> 01:48:18,241
Do I get to come home now?

1791
01:48:19,211 --> 01:48:21,270
I guess you can.

1792
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:26,645
But these cannot come.

1793
01:48:27,152 --> 01:48:28,744
- What, my pants--?
- That's correct.

1794
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:31,116
- Can't come home? Why?
- No.

1795
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:34,555
You just won a really big battle,
my friend. Come on.

1796
01:48:36,362 --> 01:48:41,857
So we're not gonna get married,
but I have to get rid of my pants.

1797
01:48:42,034 --> 01:48:44,867
Mm-hm.
And we both win.

1798
01:48:45,237 --> 01:48:48,172
All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

1799
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,374
You're getting
a lot of bids on this place?

1800
01:48:50,542 --> 01:48:53,773
Yeah. I know it's crazy,
but it's a neighborhood in transition.

1801
01:48:53,946 --> 01:48:56,938
Is that like young, hip, gay couples
or something like that?

1802
01:48:57,116 --> 01:49:01,212
Yeah. Hip gay people,
young couples, young families.

1803
01:49:04,223 --> 01:49:05,656
Wow.

1804
01:49:06,325 --> 01:49:09,226
God, this reminds me of where I grew up.

1805
01:49:09,628 --> 01:49:11,892
I bet it's got one of the--

1806
01:49:12,865 --> 01:49:14,924
Wait a minute.

1807
01:49:15,401 --> 01:49:17,665
Oh, yeah.

1808
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:21,130
Yeah, that's it.

1809
01:49:22,374 --> 01:49:24,239
We used to have the exact same one...

1810
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:27,743
...except my mom used it as a desk.

1811
01:49:29,815 --> 01:49:31,783
So...

1812
01:49:32,284 --> 01:49:35,014
...when do all the fabulous people arrive?

1813
01:49:35,187 --> 01:49:37,348
Well, actually,
the open house is tomorrow.

1814
01:49:37,523 --> 01:49:39,787
But I have this one buyer...

1815
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:43,519
...and I wanted to make sure
his girlfriend likes it first.

1816
01:49:44,096 --> 01:49:46,428
Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?

1817
01:49:47,966 --> 01:49:49,934
Yeah, I have an idea.

1818
01:49:50,102 --> 01:49:51,330
For this house.

1819
01:49:51,503 --> 01:49:52,629
For me.

1820
01:49:52,805 --> 01:49:55,569
And hopefully, if you like it...

1821
01:49:55,741 --> 01:49:58,335
...and things continue to, you know...

1822
01:49:59,945 --> 01:50:01,344
Anna...

1823
01:50:01,513 --> 01:50:03,572
...I have a plan, okay?

1824
01:50:03,749 --> 01:50:06,718
I know where my life is going,
and I want you to go with me.

1825
01:50:06,885 --> 01:50:09,149
I'm not saying I want you
to move in right now...

1826
01:50:09,321 --> 01:50:13,257
...but I don't want to buy this place
unless, at some point...

1827
01:50:13,425 --> 01:50:15,689
...you could see yourself moving in.

1828
01:50:16,261 --> 01:50:17,956
So, what do you think?

1829
01:50:19,531 --> 01:50:21,795
I can't do this.

1830
01:50:22,768 --> 01:50:24,395
Okay.

1831
01:50:25,504 --> 01:50:28,473
Well, if it's too fast,
I guess we can always just--

1832
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,870
I can't do any of this.

1833
01:50:31,577 --> 01:50:32,908
I mean...

1834
01:50:33,078 --> 01:50:37,515
...what you're saying
and what you're offering...

1835
01:50:37,683 --> 01:50:40,743
...is what every girl wants.

1836
01:50:40,919 --> 01:50:43,251
It's what I always wanted.

1837
01:50:43,422 --> 01:50:45,413
It's just...

1838
01:50:52,197 --> 01:50:53,459
You don't want it with me.

1839
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:15,343
Okay.

1840
01:51:16,822 --> 01:51:18,687
I have a question.

1841
01:51:20,092 --> 01:51:22,390
Is there any way we could...

1842
01:51:23,328 --> 01:51:26,354
...dial it back to before,
when we were just sleeping together...

1843
01:51:26,532 --> 01:51:30,593
...because I don't know,
I felt like that gelled.

1844
01:51:44,516 --> 01:51:46,074
Babe?

1845
01:52:20,752 --> 01:52:21,980
It was nice meeting you.

1846
01:52:22,154 --> 01:52:24,418
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.

1847
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:26,387
You too.

1848
01:52:32,731 --> 01:52:33,755
Good night.

1849
01:52:52,818 --> 01:52:54,911
You forget something?

1850
01:52:55,887 --> 01:52:57,878
Yeah, I did.

1851
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,920
Really? What did you forget?

1852
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:06,097
This.

1853
01:53:10,936 --> 01:53:15,396
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen?

1854
01:53:15,574 --> 01:53:16,666
Yeah.

1855
01:53:16,842 --> 01:53:22,178
I thought I should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here.

1856
01:53:22,347 --> 01:53:24,440
That's how it's done, isn't it?

1857
01:53:25,884 --> 01:53:27,215
Sometimes.

1858
01:53:27,386 --> 01:53:29,946
Look, I can't stop thinking about you.

1859
01:53:30,422 --> 01:53:31,616
It's a problem.

1860
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:36,022
I drive by your place, I call and hang up.

1861
01:53:36,194 --> 01:53:37,218
I'm turning into--

1862
01:53:37,396 --> 01:53:38,886
Me.

1863
01:53:39,831 --> 01:53:41,492
Yeah.

1864
01:53:44,603 --> 01:53:46,935
A wise person once told me...

1865
01:53:47,105 --> 01:53:51,906
...that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen, no matter what.

1866
01:53:52,077 --> 01:53:53,169
That's true.

1867
01:53:53,345 --> 01:53:56,371
But when I was hurling my body
onto yours...

1868
01:53:56,548 --> 01:53:58,675
...you did not seem
to want to make it happen.

1869
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:02,183
Yeah, all right.
Here's the thing about that:

1870
01:54:02,354 --> 01:54:03,787
You were right.

1871
01:54:03,955 --> 01:54:07,652
I've gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women...

1872
01:54:07,826 --> 01:54:09,191
...and having the power...

1873
01:54:09,361 --> 01:54:11,488
...that I didn't know what it felt like...

1874
01:54:11,663 --> 01:54:13,858
...when I actually fell...

1875
01:54:14,032 --> 01:54:16,193
...for one of them.

1876
01:54:19,237 --> 01:54:21,205
I didn't know.

1877
01:54:30,248 --> 01:54:32,614
Look, I just went out
with your friend Bill and...

1878
01:54:32,784 --> 01:54:33,842
Yeah.

1879
01:54:34,019 --> 01:54:36,579
He might be just exactly what I need.

1880
01:54:36,755 --> 01:54:38,484
No drama.

1881
01:54:38,657 --> 01:54:40,955
He calls, he does what he says.

1882
01:54:41,126 --> 01:54:43,253
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.

1883
01:54:43,428 --> 01:54:45,953
And that same wise person told me
that I am the rule.

1884
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:49,726
That I have to stop thinking
that every guy will change.

1885
01:54:49,901 --> 01:54:52,165
That I have to stop thinking that--

1886
01:55:09,488 --> 01:55:11,251
I'm the exception.

1887
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:16,919
You are my exception.

1888
01:56:00,272 --> 01:56:01,296
Conor Barry.

1889
01:56:01,473 --> 01:56:03,907
<i>Hi, it's Mary at the</i> Blade.

1890
01:56:04,075 --> 01:56:06,373
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

1891
01:56:07,312 --> 01:56:09,872
Really? You don't think the muscle T
is too much?

1892
01:56:10,549 --> 01:56:14,315
I think the shirt you're wearing now
is probably more you.

1893
01:56:16,221 --> 01:56:17,552
What, you here?

1894
01:56:17,722 --> 01:56:19,917
I'm sitting right in front of you.

1895
01:56:21,259 --> 01:56:23,159
Wow, this is you. Mary.

1896
01:56:23,328 --> 01:56:24,386
It's me.

1897
01:56:24,563 --> 01:56:25,791
I'm me.

1898
01:56:29,668 --> 01:56:30,999
Should I--?

1899
01:56:31,269 --> 01:56:32,600
- Please. Please.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1900
01:56:32,771 --> 01:56:34,796
- Talk to you in a minute.
- <i>See you in a second.</i>

1901
01:56:34,973 --> 01:56:36,838
Okay.

1902
01:56:38,577 --> 01:56:40,169
Hey.

1903
01:56:40,345 --> 01:56:41,642
- Hi.
- How are you?

1904
01:56:41,813 --> 01:56:43,212
It's nice to finally meet you.

1905
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:44,439
- You too.
- In person.

1906
01:56:45,016 --> 01:56:47,211
This is a pleasant surprise.

1907
01:56:47,385 --> 01:56:48,613
- You...
- What?

1908
01:56:48,787 --> 01:56:51,915
- I don't know. Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?

1909
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:54,456
Your voice does not match your face
in a good way.

1910
01:56:54,626 --> 01:56:57,652
In a-- Yeah, I mean--
That sounded terrible.

1911
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:04,029
Amazing.

1912
01:57:04,202 --> 01:57:06,534
I don't know how all this stuff
fit in here before.

1913
01:57:06,705 --> 01:57:09,606
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

1914
01:57:18,516 --> 01:57:22,885
You are not trying
to get these back in here.

1915
01:57:23,054 --> 01:57:25,989
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
- We had a deal, mister.

1916
01:57:26,157 --> 01:57:27,522
These are not staying.

1917
01:57:27,692 --> 01:57:32,026
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

1918
01:57:32,197 --> 01:57:34,665
They could be pressed,
flattened, you can--

1919
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:38,291
If you're gonna throw them out,
at least check the pockets, all right?

1920
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:42,099
So you don't throw away
some personal items.

1921
01:57:59,357 --> 01:58:02,588
I love you so much.

1922
01:58:03,328 --> 01:58:04,920
So much.

1923
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:07,725
And I wanna make you happy.

1924
01:58:08,366 --> 01:58:10,300
I need to make you happy...

1925
01:58:10,468 --> 01:58:14,734
...for me to even have a shot
at being happy.

1926
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:21,240
Will you marry me?

1927
01:58:26,851 --> 01:58:30,446
Yes, of course I will. Yes.

1928
01:58:30,622 --> 01:58:32,180
Yes.

1929
01:58:36,795 --> 01:58:38,592
Thank God.

1930
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:44,764
<i>Girls are taught
a lot of stuff growing up:</i>

1931
01:58:44,936 --> 01:58:47,496
<i>If a guy punches you, he likes you.</i>

1932
01:58:47,672 --> 01:58:49,902
<i>Never try to trim your own bangs.</i>

1933
01:58:50,075 --> 01:58:55,035
<i>And someday you will meet a wonderful guy</i>
<i>and get your very own happy ending.</i>

1934
01:58:55,213 --> 01:58:56,874
And your commitment
to each other.

1935
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:01,783
<i>Every movie we see,</i>
<i>every story we're told...</i>

1936
01:59:01,953 --> 01:59:03,648
<i>... implores us to wait for it.</i>

1937
01:59:04,456 --> 01:59:10,292
<i>The third act twist:</i>
<i>The unexpected declaration of love.</i>

1938
01:59:11,262 --> 01:59:13,389
<i>The exception to the rule.</i>

1939
01:59:13,565 --> 01:59:17,126
<i>But sometimes we're so focused</i>
<i>on finding our happy ending...</i>

1940
01:59:17,302 --> 01:59:19,998
<i>... we don't learn how to read the signs.</i>

1941
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:23,106
<i>How to tell the ones who want us</i>
<i>from the ones who don't.</i>

1942
01:59:23,274 --> 01:59:26,573
<i>The ones who will stay</i>
<i>from the ones who will leave.</i>

1943
01:59:35,153 --> 01:59:37,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

1944
01:59:37,555 --> 01:59:41,924
<i>And maybe this happy ending</i>
<i>doesn't include a wonderful guy.</i>

1945
01:59:43,261 --> 01:59:46,253
<i>Maybe it's you...</i>

1946
01:59:47,799 --> 01:59:49,699
<i>... on your own...</i>

1947
01:59:49,868 --> 01:59:52,928
<i>... picking up the pieces and starting over.</i>

1948
01:59:54,272 --> 01:59:58,231
<i>Freeing yourself up</i>
<i>for something better in the future.</i>

1949
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:02,946
<i>Maybe the happy ending is just...</i>

1950
02:00:03,515 --> 02:00:05,449
<i>... moving on.</i>

1951
02:00:09,254 --> 02:00:12,690
Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn.
Forget the dip. Come on, come on.

1952
02:00:12,857 --> 02:00:14,916
Let's go, Alex.

1953
02:00:15,093 --> 02:00:16,685
Come on, Alex, your turn.

1954
02:00:16,861 --> 02:00:18,123
Ready? LOL.

1955
02:00:18,296 --> 02:00:20,662
Laugh out loud! We won!

1956
02:00:20,832 --> 02:00:22,697
<i>Or maybe
the happy ending is this:</i>

1957
02:00:22,867 --> 02:00:26,735
<i>Knowing that through all the unreturned</i>
<i>phone calls and broken hearts...</i>

1958
02:00:26,905 --> 02:00:30,397
<i>... through all the blunders</i>
<i>and misread signals...</i>

1959
02:00:30,575 --> 02:00:33,544
<i>... through all of the pain</i>
<i>and embarrassment...</i>

1960
02:00:33,711 --> 02:00:37,579
<i>... you never,
ever gave up hope.</i>

1961
02:00:44,823 --> 02:00:46,381
<i>Now that
we are married...</i>

1962
02:00:46,558 --> 02:00:47,820
<i>We're gonna move.</i>

1963
02:00:47,992 --> 02:00:49,960
<i>Gonna move.</i>
<i>That's one thing we're gonna do.</i>

1964
02:00:50,128 --> 02:00:54,121
<i>Another thing we're gonna do</i>
<i>is move a little further away from...</i>

1965
02:00:54,299 --> 02:00:57,063
- <i>Baltimore?</i>
- <i>Your sisters.</i>

1966
02:00:57,735 --> 02:00:59,635
<i>I mean,
everyone makes mistakes.</i>

1967
02:00:59,804 --> 02:01:04,798
<i>I've started trying to figure out what</i>
<i>I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?</i>

1968
02:01:04,976 --> 02:01:08,605
<i>Probably seems the wrong time to do that,</i>
<i>but why not? You know, why not?</i>

1969
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:10,111
<i>Better later than never.</i>

1970
02:01:10,281 --> 02:01:11,976
<i>I'm dating now.</i>

1971
02:01:14,285 --> 02:01:16,879
<i>What do you miss
most about marriage?</i>

1972
02:01:17,055 --> 02:01:18,522
<i>Have you been married?</i>

1973
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:19,748
<i>Yes, I'm married.</i>

1974
02:01:19,924 --> 02:01:21,551
- <i>You are married?</i>
- <i>I am married.</i>

1975
02:01:21,726 --> 02:01:23,557
<i>And what's your question?</i>

1976
02:01:23,728 --> 02:01:27,562
- <i>We're heading there, is that fair?</i>
- <i>It's moving fast. Just on our way.</i>

1977
02:01:27,732 --> 02:01:30,496
<i>I like him, I'll say that L word.</i>

1978
02:01:30,668 --> 02:01:33,637
<i>That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah.</i>

1979
02:01:33,805 --> 02:01:36,205
<i>I like her a lot, so...</i>

1980
02:01:36,374 --> 02:01:38,934
- <i>Good, I'm glad.</i>
- <i>I love her. I love her.</i>

1981
02:01:39,644 --> 02:01:42,112
<i>You know, what I've been focusing</i>
<i>my energy on...</i>

1982
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,114
<i>... is like a self-discovery,</i>
<i>as opposed to dating.</i>

1983
02:01:46,284 --> 02:01:48,718
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe dating's a little overrated.</i>

1984
02:01:48,887 --> 02:01:53,654
<i>Good friend of mine and I</i>
<i>are going to India for a few months.</i>

1985
02:01:53,825 --> 02:01:55,224
<i>We're going on a yoga retreat.</i>

1986
02:01:55,393 --> 02:01:57,657
<i>I really genuinely
love this person--</i>

1987
02:01:57,829 --> 02:01:59,694
<i>He had asked me
to co-host this party...</i>

1988
02:01:59,864 --> 02:02:01,092
<i>... and I stayed after.</i>

1989
02:02:01,266 --> 02:02:04,929
<i>I was trying to help you out because</i>
<i>there was this girl who would not leave...</i>

1990
02:02:05,103 --> 02:02:07,867
- <i>... that tall girl.</i>
- <i>Right. She was gross.</i>

1991
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:09,404
<i>I was trying to--</i>

1992
02:02:09,574 --> 02:02:11,405
<i>She was--</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
