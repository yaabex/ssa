                         And so, a thousand years later Fry once 
                         again infiltrated the Infosphere and 
                         set off his amazing bomb. Only this 
                         time...

                         Thank you for saving the universe Fry. 
                          Here.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour 
                         again, just ask.

                         Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what 
                         happened.
 
               
                                     NIBBLER
                         Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain 
                         undercover so I'm blanking your memory.

                         Huh. Did everything just taste purple 
                         for a second? Oh well. Let's go home 
                         you dumb poop machine.

                         With gusto.

               in the hole.]

                         Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.

                         Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I 
                         don't care if you're not the most important 
                         person in the universe. It really makes 
                         me happy to see you right now.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Then I am the most important person 
                         in the universe.
