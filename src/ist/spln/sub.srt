1
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,477
- This is awesome.
- Oh, my God.

2
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,074
Oh, my God. This is crazy.

3
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:36,515
Oh, my God! So incredible.

4
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:39,029
Do you want to know a secret?
I took a Viagra.

5
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:40,109
- What?
- This is awesome!

6
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:41,713
Why aren't I
using this every day?

7
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,871
What'd you do?
Wait. Stop, stop, stop.

8
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:46,074
- Stop.
- What?

9
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:50,708
What's the matter?

10
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,028
"What's the matter?"

11
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,395
You just took a Viagra
to have sex with me.

12
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:56,311
I thought it
would make it better.

13
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:58,308
It was better. It takes
some of the pressure off.

14
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,234
Because you can't get
hard without a Viagra?

15
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,073
Is it because you
don't think I'm sexy?

16
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,639
I thought you'd
think it was fun

17
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,314
for me to
super-size it for once.

18
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,953
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone.

19
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,914
I was just trying to go
turbo for your birthday.

20
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,833
My hard-ons are still in analog.
This shit's digital.

21
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,476
I don't want a turbo penis.

22
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,150
I like your medium-soft one.

23
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,872
Look, I can get it up.
Just not that far up.

24
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:29,232
- Come on. You were liking it.
- Forget it. Forget it.

25
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:30,674
Debbie, come on.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,391
All right, you know what?
I'll be honest with you.

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,474
Lately, my penis hasn't been getting
as hard as it used to, all right?

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,120
And it's kind of
freaked me out.

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,911
I don't know whether or not it's because I'm
getting older or I'm losing testosterone.

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,240
No, it's what I told you. Your
artery to your heart is clogged

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,360
because you eat so much junk food,
and you have high cholesterol,

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,671
and that is directly
related to your penis vein.

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,714
My "penis vein"? Where'd
you get my penis vein?

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,918
There was a whole
Dr. Oz about it.

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,039
Cholesterol is not
clogging my penis vein.

36
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,512
Maybe I can't
get a hard-on fully

37
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,002
because, you know, I keep my
phone in my front pocket,

38
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,671
and it's radiating my balls. I'll give you that.
That makes sense.

39
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,442
Where'd you even get it from?

40
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,796
A very safe
and reputable <i>farmacia.</i>

41
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,875
Mexico? Mexico.

42
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,717
Look at this. You want
that to go to waste?

43
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,237
Looks like a plant
trying to reach the sun.

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,074
Okay, well...

45
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,517
I'll do it for 10 minutes,

46
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,993
but you have to figure out what
to do with the other four hours.

47
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,401
Stop it. Dad, stop.

48
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,033
I love you.

49
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,633
Time to get up.

50
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:03,799
Your breath smells weird.

51
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:04,953
Wake up.

52
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:09,956
I really need you to wake up.

53
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:12,914
Wake up. Come on.

54
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,283
- Time to wake up.
- Okay.

55
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,959
Ready!

56
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,835
Make a wish!

57
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:24,836
<i>Hello, Sayid.</i>

58
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,081
Can I watch <i>Lost?</i>

59
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,439
You can't handle Lost.

60
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:33,081
It's too violent,
and you won't understand.

61
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:36,204
If I don't understand it,
why can't I handle it?

62
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,276
Because you're eight.

63
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:40,802
I can handle it. I've seen a
shark eat a guy on <i>Shark Week.</i>

64
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,036
<i>Shark Week</i> is fake.

65
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,606
No, it's not.

66
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:45,599
All of it is reenactments.

67
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:46,716
I know, but they...

68
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:49,119
And that's scary. You shouldn't
be allowed to watch that.

69
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:53,201
They show the reenactments,
but they actually happened.

70
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,926
It's gonna give you nightmares.

71
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:58,205
I can handle a nightmare. You're
a nightmare every day for me.

72
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:02,637
Hey.

73
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,247
Don't eat that cupcake.

74
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,317
What?

75
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:07,921
The one you just
put into the sink.

76
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:09,687
I saw you were hiding that.

77
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,036
This cupcake? You think I'm
going to eat this cupcake?

78
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,836
- Yeah.
- I so don't want this cupcake. Look.

79
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,685
- You're still going to eat it.
- I'm going to eat that cupcake?

80
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,121
Just put it in the trash.

81
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:19,676
What would you like to do?
Your choice.

82
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,726
- Anything?
- Yeah, anything.

83
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,760
Just hang out with you guys.

84
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:27,239
Don't you want to get a
massage, or do something fun?

85
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:28,923
Forty's huge.

86
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:29,998
I'm turning 38.

87
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:32,967
Okay, 38. We will move on.

88
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,759
Isn't it weird that our
birthday is the same week,

89
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,760
and then we're going to have a
party, and it's just for me?

90
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,726
No, I don't think
it's weird at all.

91
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,005
Because you're turning
40 and I'm turning 38.

92
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,159
Come on, do you really want
to be one of those ladies

93
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,757
who's just so
insecure about their age?

94
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,277
And they lie, and then they gotta
remember, and it gets all...

95
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:52,600
You don't get it. See, you
don't understand how it works.

96
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:55,165
I don't want to shop
at old ladies' stores.

97
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,959
I don't want to go to J. Jill and
Chico's, and Ann Taylor Loft.

98
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,483
I'm not ready yet.

99
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,969
I need two more years.

100
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,723
That is so insane,
it kind of makes sense.

101
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,288
What'd you get me
for my birthday?

102
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,519
Wait a minute,
I thought you said that

103
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,521
we shouldn't get each
other gifts this year.

104
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,969
What do you mean?

105
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:13,798
You're supposed to
get me a surprise gift.

106
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,443
This is a big birthday.

107
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,488
I'm turning 40.

108
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,123
Mom!

109
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,567
Mom, why can't I get
new clothes?

110
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,405
What the fuck? Nothing fits me!

111
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,327
God damn it!

112
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,480
I'm going to go work out,
I'll be back in about an hour.

113
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,160
Hey, did your father call
to wish you a happy birthday?

114
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,928
No, but that's no surprise.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,641
- Come on.
- Coming.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,643
- You got to keep up with us, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I'm in.

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,926
That's why your body
looks like your body

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,320
and her body
looks like her body.

119
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,966
Before, after. Before, after.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,330
You guys just go on without me.
I'm just gonna...

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,970
I think I gotta...

122
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,361
Fuck.

123
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,330
Thanks for letting
me join this team.

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,447
It's not really a team.

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,090
It's just a bunch of guys
that get together and ride.

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,280
I know, I know.

127
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,007
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!

128
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,405
It's always the guy in
the fucking Infiniti.

129
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,047
Good. See, you're getting
tight here. Yeah.

130
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:38,126
- This, we need to work on.
- Okay.

131
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,284
So, why on earth is Pete taking Viagra?
What's going on?

132
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:41,568
I don't know.

133
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:47,572
I think maybe he isn't attracted
to me anymore or something.

134
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,371
- I don't know.
- Well, that is ridiculous.

135
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,883
If you were my girlfriend,
I would not need a Viagra.

136
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,886
I would need
an anti-Viagra pill...

137
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,812
To try not to get a boner.

138
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,971
But everyone gives you a boner.

139
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,246
Don't sell yourself
short like that.

140
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,887
You give me a boner.

141
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,282
Barb doesn't give me a boner.

142
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,971
Maybe things are
just getting stale.

143
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:10,173
That's why if maybe I
work out really hard...

144
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:13,451
Maybe he'll be able
to get a boner again.

145
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,811
Why do you need
to have sex, Deb?

146
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,044
Sex is the number one thing
people fight about.

147
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:21,651
You stop having sex,
there will be no more fights.

148
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:22,962
I am living proof.

149
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:24,369
I have no sex,

150
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,406
and I am the happiest
I have ever been.

151
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:29,971
I knew it. I knew you
were not having sex.

152
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,453
I can see it on your face.

153
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:33,172
It's all...

154
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:34,772
Puckered and pained.

155
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,771
I'm enjoying our non-sex
period, that's all I'm saying.

156
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,002
Don't you miss it?

157
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,402
I wouldn't know, because I don't
have any feeling down there anymore.

158
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,767
I have nerve damage
from my C-section,

159
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,561
so everything's just kind of...

160
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:46,166
She's numb down there.

161
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,363
I could sit down
hard on a fire hydrant,

162
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,366
and I wouldn't even
know that I was sitting.

163
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:56,844
I could get stung by a hornet down
there, and I would not feel it.

164
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:59,970
You could put
anything in there,

165
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,801
and I would not know
what the object was.

166
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,850
I used to pee in a nice stream,

167
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:07,242
and now it just kind of goes
like a shower head.

168
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,085
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

169
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,569
I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

170
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,607
No, I think
I want to Clooney it.

171
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,406
- Clooney it?
- Yup.

172
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:17,607
He doesn't seem happy.

173
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:19,362
Yeah, he is.

174
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,011
No, he's lonely.

175
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,168
No, he's not.

176
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,085
See, I think he has sad eyes.

177
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,323
You sweet little thing, no.

178
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:30,610
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
to get the next lady.

179
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,843
Look, I can do it, too. Watch.

180
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,049
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

181
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:39,168
Just him and his pig.

182
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,049
- You'd fuck him.
- I wouldn't.

183
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,246
- So would you.
- I would.

184
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,561
I wouldn't feel it,
but I would.

185
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,681
You'd fuck him with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

186
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,404
Ocean's Thirteen Inches, that's
what you'd find out.

187
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,127
Do you think?

188
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,650
I mean, that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

189
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,404
That's the one
thing you don't do,

190
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,642
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

191
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,529
I think that's even
on the warning label.

192
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,122
We're in one of
those phases where

193
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,648
everything that
the other person says

194
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,609
just annoys
the shit out of each other.

195
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,490
- All the time. It's a blast.
- Don't worry about it.

196
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,244
You just gotta ride that out.

197
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,011
This sounds terrible.

198
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,684
Okay, I like it.

199
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:16,040
But...

200
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,603
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like if, say,

201
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,283
you were separated
by something bigger.

202
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,885
Like death? Like her death?

203
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:29,443
I have given it
a fair amount of thought.

204
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:34,088
Not in a painful way,
just quietly slid into death.

205
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:35,366
Like a gas leak.

206
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,249
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,208
I mean, this is the mother
of your children.

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,969
You want her to die...

209
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,365
No, I'd want it
to be a peaceful...

210
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,725
gentle, you know.

211
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,690
Yeah, just like drift into a coma
from which she never awakens.

212
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,648
And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

213
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,007
That's just it,
people love widowers.

214
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,881
They love widowers. It's like the
polar opposite of divorced guys.

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
It's the best.

216
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,768
It's like,
"Oh, that poor widower."

217
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,563
"If I could only
make him happy."

218
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,161
"Somehow, ease his pain."

219
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,241
"Cock-suck away his sadness."

220
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,525
Do you know that this song,
Pixies did this song,

221
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,603
it's about a Salvador Dali short
film called <i>Un Chien Andalusia.</i>

222
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,408
This music doesn't
make people happy.

223
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,722
This song kicks off <i>Doolittle,</i> one of
the best albums of the last 30 years.

224
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,289
Look how angry you get
while listening to it.

225
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,690
An important record.

226
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,330
It's my birthday. You don't
control the radio on my birthday.

227
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I do.

228
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,208
I control the radio
on my birthday.

229
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,442
Sadie's watching Lost.

230
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,328
Sadie, how many times have
you watched Lost this week?

231
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:57,919
I only watched 11. But I have eight
more, and then I'm done, so...

232
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,887
- How many are there?
- 114.

233
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:00,925
Are you kidding me?

234
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,888
You can't watch over 100 episodes
of a show in five weeks.

235
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,244
It'll melt your brain.

236
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,967
It's not melting my brain,
it's blowing my mind.

237
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,762
That's really bad, Sadie.

238
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,761
You're not allowed to do that.

239
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,649
My relationship with Lost
is not your business.

240
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,049
It's extremely personal.

241
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,078
Stop!

242
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,167
- Stop it.
- Be nice to your sister.

243
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,559
You guys are going to
cherish each other one day.

244
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,160
Stop it! Stop!

245
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,162
It's your birthday. You
don't need to go to the store.

246
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:33,401
No, just five minutes.
Desi and Jodi are fighting.

247
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,728
All right, five minutes,
but then I'm pulling you out.

248
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,684
Hi.

249
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:39,918
Hi.

250
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,840
How's Jodi treating you?

251
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,323
Jodi?

252
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:45,246
Oh, Jodi's my new BFF.

253
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,648
She's like a little kitty-cat.

254
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,402
Sometimes she comes
and rubs up against my leg.

255
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,406
And you're a ball of shit.

256
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,048
She loves me.

257
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,360
Can you do inventory so that
we can do the sidewalk sale?

258
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:04,838
And you really need to pay
attention to the numbers

259
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,922
because we have
$12,000 unaccounted for.

260
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,244
I think it's probably Desi.

261
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:14,438
She's been having a really hard
time using these simple computers.

262
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:15,763
It's because she's stupid.

263
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,527
I think she might be stealing.

264
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,720
She's not stealing.

265
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:24,961
She's our best employee. She
made nine grand last month.

266
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,527
How much did I make?

267
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,838
You brought in $2,200.

268
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,004
That's not bad.

269
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,326
Well, it's not that good.

270
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:36,288
I mean, I'm not comparing you,
but you're not as good.

271
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,925
All right. See you.

272
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,760
I don't think she's
wearing underwear.

273
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,763
- What?
- It's all dark up there.

274
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:57,364
Why are you looking?

275
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,967
I didn't mean to look.

276
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,040
I just said, "Hey, whoa."
And there it was.

277
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,004
Maybe she's wearing
dark underwear.

278
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:09,078
Yeah, maybe she has underwear that has
a picture of a vagina painted on it.

279
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,437
Stop looking.

280
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:14,043
Some deep oranges and browns,
and maybe some dark greens.

281
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,720
That would really
play up your features.

282
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:18,720
I'll just take out my AmEx and you
pick what stuff you think's good.

283
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,845
Good job!

284
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:28,363
Where's Daddy?

285
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,040
I think he went to poop.

286
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,527
Pete!

287
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,003
Q-A-T. Suck on that, bitch.

288
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,644
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

289
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:40,486
Going to the bathroom.

290
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:45,203
We're all downstairs,
waiting for you.

291
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,046
You've been up here
for a really long time now.

292
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,036
I'm almost done.
I'll be down in a second.

293
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,597
Charlotte just did her first
flip on the trampoline

294
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,757
and she landed on her feet.

295
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,036
She was really
proud of herself.

296
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:58,364
- That's great!
- And you missed it.

297
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,804
She'll do it again.

298
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,475
It's the fourth time you've
gone to the bathroom today.

299
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,076
Give me a break.

300
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,802
Why is your instinct to escape?

301
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,559
It's not my instinct
to escape from you.

302
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,364
It is my instinct to
come into the bathroom

303
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:13,085
when I need to go
to the bathroom.

304
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:15,243
You want me to hook up
cable in here or something?

305
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:16,396
You need DirecTV?

306
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:17,681
Well, it's probably
too late for this dump,

307
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:19,564
but if you could do that for
the next one, I'd be psyched.

308
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,276
How come
I don't smell anything?

309
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:24,120
It's because I shoved an Altoid
up my ass before I came in here.

310
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:25,401
Let me see, then.

311
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,040
- What?
- Let me see.

312
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:28,321
No, I'm not going
to let you see.

313
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:29,442
You're not going to let me see,

314
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,516
because you're
not taking a poop.

315
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,364
I've been flushing as I go.

316
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:33,846
You're flushing as you go.

317
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,163
Who takes a half-hour
to go to the bathroom?

318
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,441
John Goodman.

319
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,779
Don't press "Enter." I'm not
sure I want to make that move!

320
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,617
Thank you.

321
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:48,941
<i>You know, when I
first started this label,</i>

322
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:51,987
<i>my dream was to work
with musicians and bands</i>

323
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:54,298
<i>whose music
I just admired so much.</i>

324
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,865
<i>The person that I thought, "My God,
wouldn't it be incredible to work with,"</i>

325
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:58,983
<i>was Graham Parker.</i>

326
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:05,661
<i>Tonight, we have him, solo</i>

327
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,899
<i>because we couldn't afford
to fly in The Rumour.</i>

328
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,541
<i>Graham Parker.</i>

329
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,217
It's just not my kind of music.

330
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,654
Really? What is
your kind of music?

331
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,013
I like happy music
that you can dance to.

332
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,297
Yeah, but when you
listen to a song

333
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:13,533
where somebody's singing
about something depressing,

334
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:16,182
- don't you relate to it?
- No.

335
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,174
It makes you feel
the same as they...

336
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:21,141
It makes you feel you're
a part of the human race.

337
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,576
I don't feel like that.

338
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:23,777
I like Lady Gaga.

339
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:25,818
Oh, God, of course you do.

340
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,619
- What?
- Shallow dance music.

341
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,376
It's not. It is fun.

342
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:33,454
And it's about
release and sex and power.

343
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,773
You don't have to like it. It's
really not for you, that's fine.

344
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,501
This is a job.
This is not a hobby.

345
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,379
Can't you love him,
just as a hobby

346
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,610
and sign a 15-year-old
hot girl so we can eat?

347
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,533
Graham Parker & The Rumour
had two albums

348
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,579
in the <i>Rolling Stone</i> Top 500
Best Albums of All Time.

349
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:53,649
Two of them.

350
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:58,297
If I can just sell 10,000 records
to his hardcore fanbase,

351
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,415
we're golden.

352
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,374
The last of Graham
Parker's fans just died.

353
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,929
I do know. Hardly. That sort
of music depresses people.

354
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:19,452
Hi, Charlotte.

355
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:22,337
Sadie. Sadie,
what are you listening to?

356
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:27,050
Okay. This is music
that makes people happy.

357
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,575
And this is what people buy.

358
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,292
What?

359
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,175
Right, girls?

360
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,255
Come on, Sadie.

361
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,653
Okay.

362
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,295
Why did you take it off?

363
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,367
Now, something
that really rocks.

364
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:07,327
This is called good music.

365
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:10,248
From somebody's heart.

366
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,166
This is bumming me out.
This isn't fun.

367
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,214
Just listen to these words, okay?
Just listen to the words.

368
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,689
I don't understand the words.

369
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,403
This is lyrics. This is poetry.

370
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:28,248
This is what is going to
survive in a hundred years.

371
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,484
It just doesn't
make people happy.

372
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,686
Makes me happy.
I can dance to it.

373
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:42,244
But you're the only one
in the room who's happy.

374
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:52,850
Sometimes I wish just
one of you had a dick.

375
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,442
Well, we don't want one.

376
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,241
Is there something that you can
do to be helping me right now?

377
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,447
Yeah, I'm ready to help.
Just tell me what to do.

378
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,887
Can you go get
a lunch box or something?

379
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,120
For me or for them?

380
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,479
Charlotte! I've got a test!

381
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,202
I'm coming, I'm coming.

382
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,079
Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!

383
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,164
Hi, Debbie.

384
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,524
Hi. Any day now?

385
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,406
Not really.
Three months, still.

386
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:32,003
- Hi.
- Hi.

387
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,478
Katie's dying for a play date.
Let's hook these two up.

388
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,798
That would be great. Okay,
I'll call you. Great.

389
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:37,998
Okay, great.

390
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,044
No.

391
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,357
- No, what?
- No.

392
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,007
- What?
- No.

393
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,118
She's sweet.

394
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,561
She's evil.

395
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,720
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:51,164
Listen, Charlotte really
needs to get here on time

397
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:53,237
because she needs the extra
time to just settle in.

398
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:55,199
We are on time.

399
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:57,444
Being on time
means being early.

400
00:20:58,076 --> 00:20:59,076
Okay.

401
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,756
It's nice to see you in class.
We'd like to see more of you.

402
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,725
I come to...

403
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,596
Hi, Debbie.

404
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:07,722
Grandma Molly.

405
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:11,726
How are you? I'm so happy
about the science fair.

406
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:14,035
- Thank you for coming.
- It's going very well, I heard.

407
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:16,594
Yeah. I love you. You
look so beautiful!

408
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:20,799
Happy birthday. I just
learned that you're 40.

409
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,205
Are you 40?

410
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,955
Yeah.

411
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:26,960
I remember when I was 40,
and then I blinked,

412
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,523
and there I was,
going to be 90.

413
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,874
My God, where did it go?

414
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:34,117
One day, you're going to blink
and you're going to be 90.

415
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,481
And I won't be around to see it,
and that makes me very sad.

416
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,281
I'm telling you.
I'm warning you.

417
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,114
Don't blink. Don't blink.

418
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:55,395
And then
you missed the mortgage payment,

419
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,075
<i>and that's the second mortgage.</i>

420
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:59,597
<i>You gotta tighten your belt.
You gotta go home, sit down,</i>

421
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:02,561
<i>look at your expenses,
come clean with Debbie.</i>

422
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:04,355
Oh, God. I can't tell Debbie.

423
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,592
<i>You've got to tell her, Pete.</i>

424
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,436
I mean, she knows it's bad, but
she has no idea just how bad.

425
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:11,320
<i>If you sell the house, it'll
really buy you some time.</i>

426
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,671
No, Debbie's not really
into selling the house.

427
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:16,321
<i>As your business manager and your
friend, I can't recommend that.</i>

428
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,232
<i>Hey, how funny would it be
if I bought your house?</i>

429
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:22,517
Okay. Bye.

430
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,042
<i>Hang in there.</i>

431
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:32,247
From the
retro label, Unfiltered,

432
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:36,488
<i>comes the first Graham Parker &
The Rumour record in 30 years.</i>

433
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:41,406
<i>When we play together,
the magic was just ridiculous.</i>

434
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,725
<i>And I think what we've
got is just so great.</i>

435
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:45,684
What are you doing?

436
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:48,374
I'm contextualizing him as one of
the great figures in rock history.

437
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:52,653
You can't show him
in his prime in '77,

438
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:55,408
and then jump straight
to him as he is now.

439
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:56,723
It's terrifying.

440
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,005
You have got to reverse it.
You have got to show him

441
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:03,293
as he is now, very briefly,
and then show him in 1977.

442
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,767
You have got to
<i>Benjamin Button</i> it.

443
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:07,653
I don't know what you're talking about.
All rock stars are older now.

444
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:10,328
Steven Tyler, David
Bowie, Mick Jagger...

445
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:11,563
- Paul McCartney.
- Okay. Stop it.

446
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:14,885
Everybody that you are mentioning
looks like an old woman now.

447
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,569
You're just mentioning
a bunch of Jessica Tandys.

448
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,892
Keith Richards
gets away with it.

449
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,165
But that's because Keith Richards
looked 70 when he was 40.

450
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,847
And now that he's 70,
he looks 69.

451
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:27,967
He's regenerating.

452
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:29,970
I like it, and I think
Graham Parker's sexy.

453
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:31,402
Well, would you fuck him?

454
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,091
- Yes.
- You'd...

455
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,084
You'd fuck him and
you won't fuck me?

456
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:37,886
I mean, I kind of
fucked you once,

457
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:39,923
- if you could have finished.
- I finished.

458
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,924
Okay, enough of who fucked
who and who finished what.

459
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,280
I finished.

460
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:47,605
Look, it's a retro label. That's
our niche, that's our market.

461
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,524
It costs money to break new bands.
I can't do that.

462
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,921
Okay, and also, you're the guy
who turned down Arcade Fire.

463
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,525
Everybody turned
down Arcade Fire.

464
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,011
It's crazy.
There's so many of them.

465
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,451
We don't have the money
to market a new band.

466
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:00,525
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

467
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Who's he talking to?

468
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,405
<i>The Jewish Journal.</i>

469
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,363
<i>The Jewish Journal?</i>

470
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,967
Apparently, old Jews are the only ones
who still buy hard copy of records.

471
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,008
Because they don't
like to download music.

472
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Because they don't know
what "downloading" means.

473
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,449
Why is this album different
from any other album?

474
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,279
It isn't.

475
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,599
What is he wearing?

476
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,323
It's a hat with
the Oreo logo on it.

477
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,522
Why? I don't think
he's being ironic.

478
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,000
I think he just
really likes Oreos.

479
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,799
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

480
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,328
Frank Black record
did all right.

481
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,843
The Haircut One Hundred,
not so much.

482
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,364
We have to break this record.
Otherwise, we're not here next year.

483
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:37,281
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

484
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,483
Hey, guys, how are you?

485
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:39,558
Good, man.

486
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,366
- Aren't cookies the best?
- Yeah.

487
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:44,283
<i>Jewish Journal</i> guy
loves the record.

488
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,404
Great!

489
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:47,844
Got a bit of a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

490
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:49,524
Gout?

491
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:52,163
My whole family,
they all had gout.

492
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:54,888
- Jesus.
- That's very unfortunate.

493
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:58,119
My auntie Queenie,
she had a foot like this.

494
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,120
It's like a size of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

495
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:03,722
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

496
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,446
And a couple of
bunions as well.

497
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,563
Fuck.

498
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:08,161
I've got to go
to the podiatrist,

499
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:09,840
and I hope he can
shoot me up with something.

500
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:12,362
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

501
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,279
- Bye, Graham.
- See you later, Graham.

502
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,761
Good luck with your gout.

503
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:18,200
Rock and roll, baby.

504
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:23,561
The happiest period in people's
lives is from age 40 to 60.

505
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:26,798
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

506
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,599
- It's true.
- Says who?

507
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:31,060
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that.

508
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:36,474
We have everything we need right
now to be completely happy.

509
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,754
- We're going to blink, and be 90.
- What?

510
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:42,405
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

511
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:44,284
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:45,594
Your eyes are
kind of glazing over.

513
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,278
No, I'm processing it all.

514
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:48,755
Some of these, I wrote for you.

515
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:51,802
So, we have to exercise every day.

516
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,682
Spend more time alone together.

517
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:55,875
And we have to go
to the therapist, every week.

518
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:58,404
It's a little pricey.

519
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:01,238
No stressing over tiny things.

520
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,154
Yeah, that's good.
You should do that.

521
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,156
We have to get more
involved in school.

522
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:08,437
Yeah. Have more
patience with the kids.

523
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,401
And we need to
work on our anger.

524
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,953
Yeah, I think it would be good if
you could take care of your anger.

525
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,318
No, I said both of us.

526
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:15,593
That's what I said. Our anger.

527
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:18,313
Okay, and no more smoking.

528
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,713
Yeah, you gotta cut that out.

529
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,514
I don't want to make this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

530
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,233
Yeah. Sorry.

531
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:29,235
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

532
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:31,359
We have to just let that go.

533
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,081
So, you're saying
that if we're arguing,

534
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:34,881
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

535
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,472
And not throw it
back in my face later?

536
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:38,595
Well, I don't do that,

537
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:42,357
but I will continue
not to do that.

538
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:44,757
And what did you write?

539
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,913
All of that. That's plenty.
That's a lot.

540
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,511
And you're going to eat better?

541
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,718
Oh, yeah. I've been
doing a decent job.

542
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,352
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

543
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:54,920
with having some
fries every now and again.

544
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:56,475
And then I'll smoke that day.

545
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:58,918
- That's not the same thing.
- It is the same thing.

546
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,117
I like fries.

547
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:02,433
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

548
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,831
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

549
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,913
because that puts a lot of
pressure on you, and stress,

550
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,713
and then the whole family feels it.

551
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,996
And he is a grown man, and
he's not our responsibility.

552
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,552
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

553
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,639
No. No, I haven't
been giving him money.

554
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,350
I haven't done that
for years. I told you.

555
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,639
Can you please put that down?

556
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,730
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

557
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,569
You sure you don't want to just
do a joint birthday party?

558
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:31,646
No.

559
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:32,931
- We always used to.
- No.

560
00:27:33,926 --> 00:27:36,690
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

561
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:38,565
Are you serious?

562
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:40,966
- How much?
- $12,000.

563
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:43,011
Oh, God.

564
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,252
And Desi's taking it?

565
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:45,486
Well, I don't know.

566
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:46,891
That's what Jodi said.

567
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:48,935
We really need
the store to work.

568
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:51,690
It is.

569
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,814
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

570
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,648
No, no. It's not
what I mean. I'm just...

571
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,689
Are you nervous about money?

572
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:02,450
Are we okay?

573
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,254
- Yeah.
- All right.

574
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:07,128
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

575
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,606
earning so much more than
any other employee we have.

576
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,887
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

577
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,968
We're barely
breaking even with her.

578
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:15,286
That's why we have to keep her.

579
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,572
Look at this. She's
making out with somebody.

580
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:24,215
Is she screwing him?

581
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,249
That might be like a dry hump.

582
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:28,487
Look at the position
of her skirt.

583
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,974
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

584
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:35,694
Oh, my God. This is in the middle of the day.
Customers could be in there.

585
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,130
At least she's getting some.

586
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:40,414
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

587
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:41,975
Yes.

588
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:44,490
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

589
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:45,929
You gotta give me
a little credit for that.

590
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:49,173
It's not about credit.
It's about...

591
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,167
We need to have more passion.

592
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,525
Like this.

593
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,370
That's not passionate.

594
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:56,128
It looks passionate to me.

595
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,405
What?

596
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,091
- What is she doing?
- Okay.

597
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,211
Oh, my God.

598
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,010
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.

599
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,725
- Don't do that.
- What am I doing?

600
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:12,687
Don't fart in the bed.

601
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,488
I'm not. It's the springs.

602
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:16,288
This is why we never have sex.

603
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,406
That's disgusting,
you're gross.

604
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:19,509
I don't know what
you're talking about.

605
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,694
You're so...

606
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,004
God!

607
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:26,925
<i>Sadie, Sadie,
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie</i>

608
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,729
Charlotte,
I'm doing my homework.

609
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,255
Okay, watch this. Watch this.

610
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:34,334
There's a haunted cow
back here.

611
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:38,773
I'm pretty sure
it does not have milk.

612
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,364
Moo.

613
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:46,614
Moo!

614
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,526
See that? They took me away.

615
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:54,568
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

616
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:58,053
Charlotte, how many times
do I have to tell you?

617
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:00,171
<i>Sadie, Sadie, Sadie.</i>

618
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,485
<i>Sadie is boring.</i>

619
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:17,971
You're so mean since
your body got weird.

620
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,054
Close the door.

621
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:21,727
You're no fun.

622
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:24,204
If you can just move
just a little bit more.

623
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,807
Oh, shit.

624
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:30,968
No, my boob is in there!

625
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,971
Did I tell you that my
son's going to Stanford?

626
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:36,251
No, that's great. Great for
us, and great for him.

627
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:37,483
- Cough again.
- Great school.

628
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,563
Everything looks good.

629
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:42,644
Your face is close to my face.

630
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,891
Descending colon.

631
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,647
I'm about four
feet in right now.

632
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:49,849
That's what he said.

633
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,491
Just try to breathe
through your nose.

634
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,330
That's your mouth.
Breathe through your nose.

635
00:31:59,023 --> 00:31:59,933
Are you all right?

636
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,411
Are you a grinder?
Do you grind your teeth?

637
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,405
I grind all night.

638
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,083
I think we need to
turn the gas down.

639
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:11,408
Turn it up!

640
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,963
No, we're going to
turn it down.

641
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,491
Turn it up!

642
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,203
Do you have to breathe
right on my neck?

643
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:27,447
Sorry.

644
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,691
What are you all
doing for Christmas?

645
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:31,041
I don't know.

646
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:33,023
You have a tree and everything?

647
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,888
Isn't that fun? In the spirit?

648
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,486
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

649
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:40,047
On your form, you said
you were born in 1974,

650
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:43,250
but your paper, it said '72. So I
just need to know which it is.

651
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:44,527
It's 1974.

652
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:48,170
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

653
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:50,403
you said that you
were born in 1975.

654
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,292
Didn't you tell me
you were born in 1976?

655
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:55,409
No. That's funny.

656
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,729
So, you want to go with 1974?

657
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,703
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974.

658
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:04,082
Okay.

659
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,807
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

660
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:10,410
It's okay. It's 1976.

661
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,970
I lie about my age, okay?

662
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,284
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay? Okay?

663
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:18,971
- Okay.
- Okay.

664
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:20,762
You're tightening up.

665
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,252
Oh, my gosh.

666
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:25,985
I know how old you are by
counting the rings.

667
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,450
A little gyno joke.

668
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,201
Oh, my God. Please.

669
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,651
What are you doing?

670
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:40,522
Getting ready to
go for my ride.

671
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,726
You want a blowjob?

672
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:44,723
Yeah. Why?

673
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:47,286
I really want a cigarette right now.

674
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,930
Happy to help.

675
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,448
Charlotte,
where is my backpack?

676
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:55,290
Hello?

677
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,126
Mom's busy!

678
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,850
Why are you locking the door?

679
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:00,771
Mom, what's going on in there?

680
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,410
Mom, I can't be late
for school. I have a test.

681
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:03,606
Mommy can't talk right now!

682
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,081
This isn't funny, Mom.
I need to go!

683
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,810
Mom, let me in! Please!

684
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,405
That's not gonna help!

685
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,528
Put on your shoes.
We'll meet you in the car.

686
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,405
- Sadie hurt me!
- I didn't!

687
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:14,925
So, hit her back!

688
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,081
She's faking.

689
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,964
- I'm not!
- Go downstairs!

690
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,081
Please! Sadie gave me a...

691
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,889
- Stop crying!
- Stop crying!

692
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:23,246
- Stop it!
- God damn it!

693
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:25,922
- Quit killing each other!
- Mom, please come out.

694
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,769
- Shut up!
- Stop it!

695
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:29,968
- Open the door!
- Go away!

696
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:32,163
- Open it up!
- Please!

697
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:33,321
Forget it.

698
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:36,165
No, don't forget it, don't forget it.
Don't, don't...

699
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,280
Oh, God.

700
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,833
Hey, boychik!

701
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,751
Hey!

702
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,635
It's the 11:00 from London.

703
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:53,675
Drop something valuable,
you shit!

704
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:56,226
- How you doing?
- How are you, <i>bubeleh?</i>

705
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,545
- That's loud.
- Every eight minutes, buddy.

706
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,626
You look pretty good.
Your hair is different.

707
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:05,195
Yeah, I'm growing it out.

708
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:06,910
I'd get it cut.

709
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,304
Daddy, you never play with me.

710
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:11,388
I do, but right now,
look who I'm talking to.

711
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:13,866
- Hi.
- It's your brother!

712
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:16,908
Hi. You don't look
like my brother.

713
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:20,784
I told you, honey, that's
because of the egg donor.

714
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:23,265
- Remember?
- I came from a test tube!

715
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,386
- How's business?
- It's not good.

716
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,348
Nobody wants curtains.

717
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:33,594
They think of it like a luxury.
It's not a luxury.

718
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:36,111
You need shade.
You need privacy.

719
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,226
Who wants to have
other people watch you fuck?

720
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:40,432
I know how you feel.

721
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,871
My business is going through
some growing pains right now.

722
00:35:42,945 --> 00:35:43,991
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

723
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:46,266
Don't jump on Daddy. Be
careful, don't jump on Daddy!

724
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:49,384
Remember,
Daddy has high blood what?

725
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:50,875
High blood pressure.

726
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:52,748
- That's right.
- My daddy's old.

727
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:54,747
Can you go outside
without me for a little bit?

728
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,311
Yeah. Don't go near
that little pool!

729
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,789
All right? We're going
to pee in the pool.

730
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,390
Do The Three Stooges routine
you were practicing.

731
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:03,668
I can't tell them apart.

732
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,475
I swear to God, I need tattoos.

733
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,628
Look, I wanted to
talk to you about

734
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,466
scaling back a little bit.

735
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:18,665
You know, Deb and I are... We're
thinking about selling the house.

736
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,514
I think that house
is more than you need.

737
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:23,110
I think it was too big of a
purchase when you made it.

738
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:27,152
Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going
to have to make some changes.

739
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,304
I'm going to have to cut back.

740
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,705
I understand. What do you mean?

741
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,554
With you.

742
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:34,711
I'm sorry. What?

743
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,826
I can't lend you
any more money.

744
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:40,625
No, that's a bad idea. That's
not the way to cut back.

745
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:42,713
I have three children here.

746
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:45,026
What about Claire?
Can't she get a job?

747
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,987
Claire takes care
of your brothers!

748
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:48,390
What do you want her to do?

749
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,512
If she goes to work,
then I gotta hire somebody!

750
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:51,790
Well, you've got to
figure something out

751
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:53,753
because I can't do it.
I can't do it.

752
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:55,426
Okay, fine.
Why don't we kill them?

753
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:56,904
Come on,
we'll kill two of them.

754
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,428
I'll keep the best one.

755
00:36:58,504 --> 00:37:00,312
Really, it'll save us
both a lot of trouble.

756
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,908
- Come on.
- Line up!

757
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:04,111
Line up for murder! Come on!

758
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:07,152
- Who wants to be killed?
- I do!

759
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:10,591
Okay, we're eliminating one already.
We're cheaper. You're gone.

760
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:12,233
- Murder me.
- Okay. Boom. Dead!

761
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:13,953
I'm dead!
You're dead! You're dead!

762
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,952
Kill me, kill me! All right,
the kids are murdered.

763
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:17,263
- That will save us some money.
- Daddy is the best!

764
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:19,267
Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

765
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,186
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

766
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,544
Because Claire wanted a baby.

767
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,071
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

768
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,590
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

769
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,870
The doctor, when we're doing in
vitro, is winking at me like...

770
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,553
"Don't worry, don't worry."

771
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:34,943
We were very unlucky.

772
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:37,071
And now, we have these
three beautiful children.

773
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:39,233
Come on. I gotta
tell you something.

774
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,384
What?

775
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,713
Your mother wanted you aborted.

776
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:54,063
Jesus Christ.

777
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,111
No, no. It's the truth.

778
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:58,785
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

779
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:02,589
That's what everybody did. You did
some blow, had sex, had an abortion.

780
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,189
- Really?
- Yes.

781
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,186
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

782
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,948
I said, "Let's stop,
have a pizza, talk about it."

783
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:11,913
"If you still wanna do it
after lunch, it's okay."

784
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,105
The pizza saved your life.

785
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:17,585
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

786
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:20,554
So, how much do I owe
you for saving my life?

787
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:23,308
I don't have a number. You just
keep giving like you're giving.

788
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,350
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.

789
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

790
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:26,744
Why aren't you
playing with the kids?

791
00:38:26,824 --> 00:38:28,587
We were playing
all day with them.

792
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:32,748
Pete is just talking to me
about his 40th birthday party.

793
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:34,353
Whatever I can do to help.

794
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,754
Okay. Did you feed them?

795
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,393
I fed half of one.

796
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:38,794
Half of...

797
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:40,871
Let's go, we'll feed them.
Mommy will feed them.

798
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:45,470
Who wants tuna with
a side of jet fuel?

799
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,788
Hi, I'm looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man.

800
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,309
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

801
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,513
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

802
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:13,947
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

803
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,826
that he's really
passionate about.

804
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:18,782
How's Sadie doing?

805
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:22,184
The last time I saw her, she was
throwing her Cheerios on the floor.

806
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:23,627
What a mess.

807
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:24,988
Right.

808
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:27,667
She just got her period.

809
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:33,183
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

810
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,151
It would be nice to
see more of each other.

811
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:41,102
Well, we can certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

812
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,947
- That would be nice.
- It would.

813
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:49,631
Do you have a day that is better...
A good day?

814
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:52,342
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

815
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,426
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

816
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,743
- Right, right.
- I mean, we're both so busy.

817
00:39:56,823 --> 00:40:00,429
I have young children,
you have young children.

818
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:04,143
I don't think we should judge
ourselves too harshly about that.

819
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:08,147
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

820
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:12,352
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

821
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:15,983
And then, we can spend more
time together, it'd be nice.

822
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:18,468
It'd be nice.

823
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,792
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

824
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:25,547
Yeah.

825
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:30,907
This is Kel, my son.

826
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:34,344
He's handsome. He's 13?

827
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:40,467
And that's Alexandra, my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

828
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,506
A lot like you.

829
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:45,871
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

830
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:49,431
Excuse me, dear,
I gotta go to the restroom.

831
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,546
- Be right back.
- Okay.

832
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,873
Daddy and I are
making some changes

833
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,946
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

834
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,355
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

835
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,706
- I think it looks great.
- Doesn't it look good?

836
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,984
What is that, grilled cheeses?

837
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,432
No, baked tofu.

838
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,189
It's actually really tasty.

839
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:43,505
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

840
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:47,031
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

841
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,595
without dressing.

842
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:51,834
No, dressing always gets in the way
of the natural taste of the lettuce.

843
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,033
And another thing we've decided

844
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:58,747
is to cut back on
all of the electronics we use.

845
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:03,636
Basically, what we're going to
do, is get rid of the Wi-Fi

846
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:05,555
and only use the computer...

847
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:07,708
What?...from 8:00
to 8:30 at night.

848
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:09,186
How are we gonna
go on the computer?

849
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,593
We're gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

850
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,270
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

851
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:16,031
You can't do this. You
can't take away the Wi-Fi.

852
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:18,474
No Wi-Fi!

853
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:20,276
You don't spend
enough time with the family

854
00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:24,238
when you're constantly on your
iPhone and your computer.

855
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:27,754
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

856
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:29,670
So, you won't see
me after five years?

857
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,148
No, but you won't
be living with us.

858
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,029
And you should get to
know your little sister.

859
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,997
You've got the perfect
friend, right here.

860
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:37,957
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

861
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:41,316
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

862
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:44,119
I don't wanna hang out
with her when I'm in my 20s.

863
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,553
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

864
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:48,438
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

865
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:52,434
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build a fort outside.

866
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:54,796
- What?
- Yeah, build a fort.

867
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:56,280
Play with your
friends and have...

868
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:59,080
Make a fort? Outside?

869
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:00,476
And do what?

870
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:02,358
Do what in the fort?

871
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:06,639
When I was a kid, we used to build
tree houses and play with sticks.

872
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,317
Nobody plays with sticks.

873
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,076
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

874
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,391
Play kick the can.

875
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,915
Look for dead bodies.

876
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,555
It's fun. That's fun to do.

877
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,310
Get a tire and then just take a stick
and run down a street with it.

878
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,075
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

879
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:22,681
You don't need technology.

880
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,401
No technology!

881
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:25,558
Charlotte, put that down.

882
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:29,841
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

883
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:31,282
I don't do anything bad.

884
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:32,682
Nobody said you were bad.

885
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,321
I don't do things
I'm not supposed to.

886
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:36,075
I don't illegally
download music.

887
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:37,995
I don't look at
porn like Wendy.

888
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:41,156
She is up to no good. She's not
allowed to come over here anymore.

889
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:42,233
What's porn?

890
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:43,359
No, she said "corn."

891
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:45,753
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

892
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:46,913
I'm not hungry.

893
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,201
- No computer.
- Listen to your mom.

894
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:50,757
I need to use it
for my homework.

895
00:43:53,913 --> 00:43:55,244
She's outplaying us.

896
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:58,394
I know. She's tough.

897
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:03,795
This is the best
birthday present.

898
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:04,920
It's good to get away.

899
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:06,597
We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

900
00:44:06,673 --> 00:44:08,675
I know. If we're
happy, they're happy.

901
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:10,882
Yeah, I mean, I can't take it.

902
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:13,156
With the hormones,
and the crying.

903
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,043
- Jesus.
- And "do my homework."

904
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,275
Them's lil' bitches.

905
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,881
Them's lil' bitches. Bugging
us for shit all the time.

906
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:22,195
And they never
appreciate anything.

907
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:25,198
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

908
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:29,878
I feel bad. I love them.

909
00:44:29,955 --> 00:44:31,002
I know.

910
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,686
I miss them already.
Should we go home?

911
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:35,241
Nah.

912
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:18,964
Why do we fight?

913
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,403
I don't know,
it makes no sense.

914
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:21,718
It makes no sense.

915
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,608
When we get in a fight,

916
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:26,761
look at my eyes and let's
remember this moment, right now,

917
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,409
and know that we
never have to fight.

918
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,608
But you're such
a dick sometimes.

919
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:32,044
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

920
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,447
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

921
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,842
Thank you for admitting that.

922
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,685
And you get so mad at me, I
feel like you want to kill me.

923
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,483
I do want to kill you.

924
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:42,880
How would you do it?

925
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,042
I don't know. I'd poison you.

926
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,166
I'd poison your cupcakes that you
pretend not to eat every day.

927
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,050
And just put enough in
to just slowly weaken you.

928
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,121
I love it.

929
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I would enjoy our last few
months together. Me too.

930
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,801
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

931
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,723
And I could take care of you...

932
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,167
But while killing you.

933
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:03,284
See, you know
what I love about us?

934
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:04,806
You can still surprise me.

935
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:08,010
I figured, for sure, you'd knock me
out with one fell swoop of poison.

936
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:10,402
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

937
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:13,326
Have you ever
thought about killing me?

938
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:14,448
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

939
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,523
Sure.

940
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:16,923
- How would you do it?
- Wood chipper.

941
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,487
- A wood chipper?
- Yeah.

942
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:19,643
A wood chipper.

943
00:46:19,722 --> 00:46:20,848
Yeah.

944
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,413
I know. Did you see <i>Fargo?</i>

945
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:24,529
Yeah.

946
00:46:27,402 --> 00:46:30,326
That's a bad plan. The
cupcakes is a way better plan.

947
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:31,609
It is. You're right.

948
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:33,412
You know what?
I won't murder you.

949
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:36,683
I love you.

950
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,244
I love you, too.

951
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,483
- Do you know what I brought?
- What?

952
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:43,089
A medical marijuana cookie. Ben
gave it to me last Christmas.

953
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:44,324
What?

954
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:45,410
- Yeah. I brought it.
- You did?

955
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:46,530
Chocolate chip kooky.

956
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:47,605
Should we do it?

957
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,654
Let's eat the cookie and then we'll
order a bunch of cheeseburgers.

958
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,488
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

959
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:56,051
Just get all of it. You
deserve it, you really do.

960
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:57,734
Wouldn't you
rather have me around

961
00:46:57,804 --> 00:47:00,887
for less years and I'm incredibly
happy, than longer and miserable?

962
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,884
Yes, and I just
realized that right now.

963
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,126
- Go get the cookie.
- I'm getting the cookie.

964
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:06,650
Go get the cookie.

965
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,805
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

966
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,295
Yeah. Should we
get a block of porn?

967
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:14,652
I don't think we
need 24 hours of porn.

968
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:18,286
But you know, two porns costs just
about as much as a 24-hour block.

969
00:47:18,646 --> 00:47:19,977
I think that's too much porn.

970
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:23,688
We don't have to watch it all, but
for the value, it makes sense.

971
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:25,886
How much are we
supposed to eat?

972
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,008
I don't know. I think six
or seven cookies, right?

973
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:30,806
Plus, it's old, it probably
has lost some of its...

974
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,570
Potency.

975
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,969
We should have sex more.

976
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,095
I mean, girls have it so easy.

977
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,569
You just show up with your sexual
organs and you're good to go.

978
00:47:42,647 --> 00:47:43,887
All the pressure is on the guy.

979
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:44,968
It's true.

980
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:48,017
And I look at guys... Like, I
look at a guy like Prince,

981
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:49,418
and you know that guy fucks.

982
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:50,488
Yeah.

983
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:52,929
I know I don't fuck like Prince.

984
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:54,294
Prince can fuck.

985
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:56,092
I fuck like David Schwimmer.

986
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,539
You do.

987
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:03,534
You know, I fuck
like Ross from <i>Friends.</i>

988
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,289
Looks good.

989
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:17,695
How does he do it?

990
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:20,851
The floating spoon.

991
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,218
Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

992
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,375
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

993
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,256
I ate my dick!

994
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,939
Kelly, I think
this room has rodents.

995
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,296
There! Just saw it.

996
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,573
Have you seen my starfish?

997
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:40,059
Where did I put my starfish?

998
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,212
My God.

999
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:45,102
I'm gonna deep
throat this clair.

1000
00:48:46,411 --> 00:48:47,691
I wanna make out
with you so bad.

1001
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:54,733
I felt like I was gonna choke!

1002
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,098
That was nice.

1003
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:34,416
Mom, Charlotte's crying

1004
00:49:34,494 --> 00:49:36,098
because she's got
an ear infection again.

1005
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,144
I didn't know what to do.

1006
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,113
We're home.

1007
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,035
Are you okay?

1008
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:45,477
What's the matter?

1009
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:49,516
I wanna rip my ear off,
it hurts so much.

1010
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:53,114
I told you that pediatrician didn't
know what he was talking about.

1011
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:55,279
Come on, you can't
blame it on our doctor.

1012
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:56,952
Ear infections are
common in little kids.

1013
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:59,432
Not in kids over six years old.

1014
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:01,752
We're going to
the Eastern doctor.

1015
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,271
If she's in this much pain, then
we should call a real doctor.

1016
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:06,836
Are you kidding right now?

1017
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,074
I know. Okay. Yup.

1018
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:14,472
What we should do
is easy and simple.

1019
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,113
No more dairy, no more
wheat, no more sugar.

1020
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,560
- Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.
- Yeah.

1021
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:21,237
What the fuck is left?

1022
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:22,473
Sorry.

1023
00:50:23,072 --> 00:50:25,040
Isn't everything sugar,
wheat, and dairy?

1024
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,081
She can have
vegetables and fruits.

1025
00:50:27,312 --> 00:50:29,072
Oh, but she can eat fruits.

1026
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,483
Fruits. Yeah.

1027
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:31,872
Any kind of fruit?

1028
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,352
Mangos, pineapple.

1029
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:34,837
It isn't, there are safe fruits

1030
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,954
- and then there are unsafe fruits?
- No, no.

1031
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,399
What about French fries?

1032
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,163
- Could we do something like that?
- Are you okay?

1033
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:42,202
- Would you like to come on the table?
- I'm okay, I'm...

1034
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:43,679
Why don't you go on the table?

1035
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:44,953
I don't wanna go on the table.

1036
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:46,233
No. It looks like you
need to get on the table.

1037
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:47,553
I don't wanna get on the table.

1038
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:56,843
Pete!

1039
00:51:00,073 --> 00:51:01,484
God damn it.

1040
00:51:04,234 --> 00:51:05,395
What are you doing?

1041
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:08,524
I need you to look at
something. In my butt.

1042
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:12,395
Why?

1043
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:14,203
I think I got
something in there,

1044
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:17,158
and I'm not
limber enough to see.

1045
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:19,396
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1046
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:23,724
I think I might have an anal fissure, or
a hemorrhoid, or a worm or something.

1047
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:28,119
What are you
doing with your phone?

1048
00:51:28,194 --> 00:51:31,234
I'm trying to take pictures of it so I
can compare it to something on Google.

1049
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:37,357
Can we just keep
just a small shred of mystery

1050
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:39,922
in our relationship, please?

1051
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:42,163
Look, I saw you
have two babies, okay?

1052
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:43,880
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1053
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:46,646
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1054
00:51:47,155 --> 00:51:48,805
Payback time.

1055
00:51:57,236 --> 00:51:58,397
It's a hemorrhoid.

1056
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,556
Thank you.

1057
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,078
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1058
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:11,838
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1059
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,724
Think. Where do you think?

1060
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:21,397
I don't want
this to sound harsh,

1061
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:23,516
but everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1062
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,844
Everything that
goes into it is a dick.

1063
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:27,761
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1064
00:52:28,077 --> 00:52:29,158
A dick.

1065
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:30,438
Don't say that.

1066
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:33,840
I'm sorry. I'm just being
protective of the store.

1067
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:36,001
I'm going to go talk to her.

1068
00:52:41,797 --> 00:52:42,923
Hey, Desi.

1069
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,238
- Hi.
- Hi.

1070
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:46,366
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1071
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:47,878
Yeah.

1072
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,118
It's so nice.

1073
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:50,324
Do you love it?

1074
00:52:50,518 --> 00:52:53,567
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1075
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,129
Hey, Desi,
would you mind wearing

1076
00:52:57,198 --> 00:52:58,999
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1077
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:01,086
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1078
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:02,644
- Will that be okay?
- Yeah.

1079
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:06,405
Perfect.

1080
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:07,889
Good?

1081
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:11,206
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1082
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,564
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1083
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:15,809
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1084
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:18,763
and then I actually
transferred it to the T-shirt.

1085
00:53:20,279 --> 00:53:23,203
So, you stenciled on the tiger?

1086
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,202
I drew it on
a piece of paper and then

1087
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,845
I transferred
the drawing to the T-shirt.

1088
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,328
You have an amazing body.

1089
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:31,605
Really?

1090
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,159
Yes. Are those real?

1091
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:36,603
- My boobs?
- Yeah.

1092
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,167
Yeah. Do you wanna touch them?

1093
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,485
Really?

1094
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:41,885
Touch them.

1095
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,161
Okay.

1096
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,686
Jesus.

1097
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,444
I mean, they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1098
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,601
They're like a memory mattress.

1099
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,403
It's like Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1100
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,524
They look amazing.

1101
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,167
My kids just sucked
the meat right out of mine.

1102
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:10,647
- No.
- Yeah.

1103
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:11,802
There's some meat in there.

1104
00:54:11,921 --> 00:54:15,892
My boobs are just gone. Since I
had kids, my boobs are just gone.

1105
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,726
They didn't even say goodbye,
you know? They just left.

1106
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:22,483
By the time I'm 40, these are gonna
go <i>National Geographic</i> on me.

1107
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,681
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1108
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:29,767
I think this is a
really good offer on the house.

1109
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:31,485
We expected more.

1110
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,086
I know it's a bad market,

1111
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:35,243
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1112
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:38,929
<i>I know, but based on what the market's
like, it's like you're gaining money,</i>

1113
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:40,882
<i>because it's so much
more than what you deserve.</i>

1114
00:54:41,562 --> 00:54:42,762
<i>But these people are from Iran</i>

1115
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,169
<i>and they don't really know that
they're offering too much.</i>

1116
00:54:45,242 --> 00:54:47,927
<i>Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?</i>

1117
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:49,886
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

1118
00:54:50,002 --> 00:54:51,811
<i>There's a lot of
inventory out there.</i>

1119
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,765
<i>I mean, what is her problem?</i>

1120
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:56,687
She has
unrealistic expectations.

1121
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,526
I'm faster than you!

1122
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:01,132
We're Jewish!

1123
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:04,685
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1124
00:55:05,123 --> 00:55:06,966
It's Jack.

1125
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:08,729
Hey, Jack.

1126
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:10,289
My daddy doesn't know my name!

1127
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:11,643
Okay, come on, let's go.

1128
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:14,772
Can I go show them my
crystals before they leave?

1129
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:15,964
Yeah, really quick.

1130
00:55:16,123 --> 00:55:18,285
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1131
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,606
Okay. Go play with
your tiny uncles.

1132
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:23,563
- Let's play murder!
- Yeah. Let's go.

1133
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:25,367
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1134
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:30,131
I'm getting rid of everything in the
house that has gluten or sugar.

1135
00:55:30,444 --> 00:55:31,969
Why? What's wrong with gluten?

1136
00:55:32,044 --> 00:55:33,375
Gluten's really bad for you.

1137
00:55:33,804 --> 00:55:35,090
I don't think so. It's wheat.

1138
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:36,405
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

1139
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:37,850
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1140
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:41,493
Hey, Mom, we were wondering if we
can use the computer to iChat?

1141
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,886
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1142
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:45,649
Yeah, but I have a friend over.

1143
00:55:46,284 --> 00:55:47,774
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1144
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:51,165
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1145
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:52,615
Hey, remember the Alamo?

1146
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,214
Have you ever
built a fort, Wendy?

1147
00:55:54,324 --> 00:55:55,485
Like, on Facebook?

1148
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:58,127
I will take this if you're
gonna throw it away,

1149
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:00,492
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1150
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,845
But don't you want to live long
enough to see your kids grow up?

1151
00:56:04,245 --> 00:56:05,656
That's up to God, honey.

1152
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:07,893
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1153
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,133
The kids eat grass,
this is fine.

1154
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:13,096
Wendy's mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1155
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,815
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1156
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:16,649
as long as
I finish my homework.

1157
00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:18,126
Yeah.

1158
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:20,089
Well, I guess
I'm not the cool one,

1159
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:22,645
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1160
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:25,128
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1161
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:27,254
She does. She's so smart.

1162
00:56:27,686 --> 00:56:29,097
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1163
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:30,697
See, your rules are ridiculous.

1164
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:32,053
Don't sass me.

1165
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:35,376
I'm only sassing you because you're
throwing out all the food in our house

1166
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:37,096
and I'm freaking starving.

1167
00:56:37,206 --> 00:56:38,287
You're being stupid.

1168
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:40,210
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1169
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:41,572
- Yeah.
- Mom.

1170
00:56:41,726 --> 00:56:42,852
Give me your iPhone, now.

1171
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:44,377
The nougat things are good.

1172
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:46,366
I have all my
contacts in there.

1173
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:48,290
Okay, if you don't give me
your phone right now,

1174
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,807
then I'm gonna have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1175
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:52,975
Jesus Christ, I need
my computer to do homework.

1176
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:54,731
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1177
00:56:54,887 --> 00:56:55,934
This is B.S.

1178
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:58,772
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1179
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:00,851
Kids! Time to go!

1180
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:02,731
You go to your room, right now.

1181
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:04,253
You are not allowed to use

1182
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:09,010
iPhone, iPad,
iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

1183
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:11,050
Pandora, or Spotify.

1184
00:57:11,447 --> 00:57:14,337
She's a little pip,
just like her mommy.

1185
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:18,378
So, I might have
a job tomorrow.

1186
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:21,614
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1187
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,648
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1188
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:26,569
Okay.

1189
00:57:27,888 --> 00:57:29,253
This is nice.

1190
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,570
You and I don't spend
enough time together, do we?

1191
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,659
We spend enough time together.

1192
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:34,929
We do?

1193
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:37,217
It's quality time.

1194
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:40,853
Then we do.

1195
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,758
I'll go with what you think.

1196
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,508
What else did they say?

1197
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:47,429
All right,
some kid named Joseph...

1198
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,155
- I know Joseph.
- You do?

1199
00:57:49,345 --> 00:57:50,949
He's making
a "hot-or-not" list.

1200
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,466
What?

1201
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:54,866
Sadie said, "That's so lame and
immature that you're doing that."

1202
00:57:54,945 --> 00:57:58,836
And then Joseph says, "Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun."

1203
00:57:58,945 --> 00:58:00,595
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1204
00:58:01,385 --> 00:58:03,069
That is not nice.

1205
00:58:03,385 --> 00:58:05,274
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1206
00:58:05,345 --> 00:58:06,835
And Joseph said,
"I didn't call you a bitch."

1207
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,515
"I said don't
act like a bitch."

1208
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,667
"And by the way, you're
in the 'Not-Hot' column."

1209
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:13,233
Who made him
the judge of "hot"?

1210
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:15,465
Do you realize what that
could do to her self-esteem?

1211
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,953
What a little fuckhead.
I'll kill him.

1212
00:58:18,105 --> 00:58:20,346
Then Sadie said, "You're
in the jackass column."

1213
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:22,234
"I gotta go, I'm bored of you."

1214
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:25,271
That is cool.
That's taking the high road.

1215
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:26,830
And then, for some reason,

1216
00:58:26,905 --> 00:58:29,988
there's an emoticon
of a panda doing push-ups.

1217
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,630
I wonder what that means.

1218
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:35,672
I don't think it means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

1219
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,351
Aww.

1220
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:38,791
Well, she's a good girl.

1221
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:41,636
She was polite and she
stood up for herself.

1222
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:43,435
That's pretty cool.

1223
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,072
What?

1224
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:46,306
- Shit.
- What?

1225
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:47,666
I thought she was coming in.

1226
00:58:47,705 --> 00:58:49,469
Oh, my God,
that scared me to death.

1227
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,195
If she caught us,
she would kill us.

1228
00:58:51,305 --> 00:58:52,636
She would. She would kill us.

1229
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:01,992
I gotta make a call.

1230
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,227
We sold how many?

1231
00:59:06,306 --> 00:59:09,355
612 album downloads.

1232
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,953
Wait a minute. There
are no zeroes after that?

1233
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:15,667
<i>There are zeroes, but all
of them are before 612.</i>

1234
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,072
<i>There are none after.</i>

1235
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:18,677
How is that even possible?

1236
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:21,192
<i>Well, out of
300 million Americans,</i>

1237
00:59:21,346 --> 00:59:25,237
<i>612 people chose
to download the album.</i>

1238
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:28,429
<i>You could personally call
everyone who bought this record.</i>

1239
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:30,947
We're fucked, we're fucked.

1240
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:33,747
Here's the deal, I want you to
meet me tomorrow morning at 8:00.

1241
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:37,188
I want a list of at least 30 ideas
of what we can do to change this.

1242
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:38,597
We have to change this.

1243
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,437
I started a record label
because I couldn't get a job,

1244
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:43,873
so I have no other options.

1245
01:00:03,026 --> 01:00:04,312
What financial problems?

1246
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:06,111
Well, I mean, for one thing,
you were right.

1247
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,508
You are missing about
$10,000 from the store.

1248
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,146
And then, Pete's
record not selling well.

1249
01:00:12,226 --> 01:00:13,591
Pete's record not selling...

1250
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,908
I thought we weren't supposed
to hear for three weeks.

1251
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:17,313
- We heard.
- You heard?

1252
01:00:17,387 --> 01:00:18,593
And they're bad.

1253
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,988
It's that and it's the money that
he's been lending his father.

1254
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,910
That's creating a strain.

1255
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:26,116
How much have we lent him?

1256
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,388
Eighty thousand.

1257
01:00:27,627 --> 01:00:31,188
Did you say 8,000 or 80,000?

1258
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,908
80,000, over
the past couple of years.

1259
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,151
And then you missed
the mortgage payment.

1260
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:37,388
On the house?

1261
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,994
And you missed
the rental on the office.

1262
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:43,033
Does Pete know that?

1263
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,753
Yeah, we're on
the phone all the time.

1264
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:47,916
Look, I know you're
going through a hard time.

1265
01:00:47,987 --> 01:00:51,594
And I want you guys to know
that we're here for you, okay?

1266
01:00:51,707 --> 01:00:53,835
Anything you guys need,
that's why we're here.

1267
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:55,995
We're here for times like this.

1268
01:00:56,227 --> 01:00:57,513
What are you gonna do?

1269
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,589
There's not much I can do.

1270
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:10,913
What are you doing?

1271
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:14,308
I'm drawing the album cover
for Van Halen's <i>Diver Down.</i>

1272
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,636
If you spent a little bit more
time focusing on Graham Parker

1273
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,038
instead of
drawing album covers,

1274
01:01:19,347 --> 01:01:20,792
I wouldn't be in
this predicament.

1275
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:22,631
I'm focused on Graham Parker.

1276
01:01:22,787 --> 01:01:24,471
You're supposed to
help me with him.

1277
01:01:24,587 --> 01:01:26,067
You're supposed to
call the companies.

1278
01:01:26,147 --> 01:01:28,468
You're supposed to
get people to the show.

1279
01:01:28,628 --> 01:01:30,232
I've done
everything I can, Pete.

1280
01:01:30,308 --> 01:01:32,037
You had me
pushing around a corpse.

1281
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,516
It was like being in fucking
Weekend at Graham's.

1282
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:36,352
What should we do?
I'm out of ideas.

1283
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:38,232
You fly in The Rumour.

1284
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:42,512
I can't sell a reunion concert
without the band, it's ridiculous.

1285
01:01:42,988 --> 01:01:44,831
With what? I can't afford it.

1286
01:01:44,908 --> 01:01:47,479
You put this on yourself.
You wanted the responsibility.

1287
01:01:47,548 --> 01:01:50,154
Take it on the fucking chin,
and stop acting like a bitch.

1288
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:51,753
What did you call me?

1289
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:52,954
Chin.

1290
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,829
Pete. Wait, Pete!

1291
01:01:57,148 --> 01:01:58,673
Hey, I have an apartment.

1292
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,591
I have health insurance,
I have car payments.

1293
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:01,874
I have responsibilities.

1294
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:04,758
You have responsibilities? Don't
talk to me about responsibilities.

1295
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:07,195
I have a life. I have a family.

1296
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:10,432
I can't afford to sit in my apartment
getting high, jerking off,

1297
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:13,193
and then going to Tommy's Chili
Burgers at 3:00 in the morning.

1298
01:02:13,268 --> 01:02:15,589
That's not even the order
that that happens in!

1299
01:02:16,188 --> 01:02:18,350
I have everything to lose, here.
Everything.

1300
01:02:18,628 --> 01:02:22,349
Yes, because you spent thousands
of dollars on shit we don't need.

1301
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:26,593
You really need to spend $30,000
on a fucking neon sign, dude?

1302
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:30,794
Which is inside, it's not even outside.
We know where we work.

1303
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,628
If you want to sign a band, you gotta
look like you're the real deal.

1304
01:02:33,828 --> 01:02:37,071
Princess Labia, how much is it
to fucking fly The Rumour in?

1305
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:38,269
It's 12,000.

1306
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,719
$12,000!

1307
01:02:39,868 --> 01:02:41,472
All right, you know what? Fine.

1308
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,399
Fly in The Rumour.
Put it on my AmEx.

1309
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,682
No, you said it was impossible.

1310
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,883
I don't think
I said "impossible."

1311
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,246
Yeah.

1312
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,084
I usually don't
say "impossible."

1313
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,891
I like to leave
some wiggle room.

1314
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:02,087
You said that my fibroid
was like a giant boulder,

1315
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,846
like the one from
the Indiana Jones movies

1316
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,810
- blocking up my uterus.
- Uterus.

1317
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,041
And I need to stop using that
reference of Indiana Jones.

1318
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,768
I think that that's not appropriate when
talking about the reproductive system.

1319
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:18,287
It's okay.

1320
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,444
Anyway, somehow the
Eastern medicine has worked,

1321
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:24,332
and the fibroid has dissipated.

1322
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,285
- That's great!
- Yes.

1323
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:28,562
Yes.

1324
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:31,690
Your fibroid shrunk and somehow

1325
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:34,844
it allowed you to get pregnant.

1326
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,363
What?

1327
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:43,368
You're gonna have
your third baby.

1328
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:45,166
Congratulations.

1329
01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:49,163
No.

1330
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:51,408
Yes.

1331
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:58,127
Would you like some water?

1332
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,532
That's good news.

1333
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:03,973
Another baby.

1334
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:05,204
At 40.

1335
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:06,530
Debbie?

1336
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,293
I am thrilled.

1337
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:14,609
And Pete is gonna be so happy.

1338
01:04:15,963 --> 01:04:17,806
So, you're okay?

1339
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:21,414
What a relief.

1340
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:24,613
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1341
01:04:25,123 --> 01:04:26,807
It's been, like...

1342
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:34,849
It's okay.

1343
01:04:36,124 --> 01:04:37,888
I'm so happy, though, you know?

1344
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:40,331
I really am, because, I mean...

1345
01:04:40,884 --> 01:04:42,045
It's good.

1346
01:04:42,884 --> 01:04:45,205
Great. Great.

1347
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

1348
01:05:38,046 --> 01:05:40,253
Why are you in a bathrobe? It's
the middle of the afternoon.

1349
01:05:40,326 --> 01:05:43,648
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1350
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:45,928
I'm sorry about the record.

1351
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:49,534
You're going through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1352
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:52,537
This is a horrible time in human history.
What is that?

1353
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,856
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1354
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:59,369
This is
a drawing by John Lennon.

1355
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,935
I got it 10 years ago
for $5,000.

1356
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:03,367
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1357
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:04,767
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1358
01:06:05,767 --> 01:06:07,496
I don't want this.

1359
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:09,690
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1360
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:12,493
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1361
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,729
That way, I can give it to you
and you make some money,

1362
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:16,293
and Debbie won't know
that I'm giving you anything.

1363
01:06:16,528 --> 01:06:19,452
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1364
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:22,259
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1365
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:24,928
I don't know. Sell it online.

1366
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,495
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1367
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:30,135
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1368
01:06:30,288 --> 01:06:32,256
All right. Don't get snippy.

1369
01:06:33,168 --> 01:06:36,012
Just because you write a great
song doesn't mean you can draw.

1370
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,814
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1371
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,535
I think it's a Ringo.

1372
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:43,177
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1373
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:45,816
Don't take anything
less than $6,500 for that.

1374
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,051
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1375
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,733
I want you to sell
it so I can help you.

1376
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:51,169
Okay.

1377
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:53,451
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1378
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:55,850
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1379
01:06:56,129 --> 01:06:59,497
No, don't buy wine with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1380
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:00,696
That's mean.

1381
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,413
- I love you. Bye.
- All right.

1382
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,819
How do I call eBay?

1383
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:09,777
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1384
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,298
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1385
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,817
I don't know. It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1386
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,220
I think he might like you.

1387
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,341
She's so cute. She's so tall.

1388
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,816
I know.

1389
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,977
How did that happen?

1390
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,979
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1391
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:35,100
No. Never for a second.

1392
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:38,177
Never.

1393
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,821
- Never?
- Never.

1394
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:41,497
I love what we have.

1395
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,057
One? A breeze.

1396
01:07:43,371 --> 01:07:44,782
Two? Brutal.

1397
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:47,498
Three? Put a bullet in my head.

1398
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:52,380
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady from school,

1399
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,374
and I just feel bad for her.

1400
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:56,534
And I feel bad for the kid.

1401
01:07:56,892 --> 01:07:58,257
Can you imagine?

1402
01:07:58,372 --> 01:08:00,500
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1403
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:04,497
"Oh, she's the one sitting in that
scooter, eating a soft cracker."

1404
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:07,379
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1405
01:08:07,692 --> 01:08:10,457
You know what? It would also be nice
for us to spend some time apart.

1406
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:13,662
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1407
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:16,463
It'd be so great to not
see you for a chunk of time,

1408
01:08:16,532 --> 01:08:18,102
so that I could
really just miss you.

1409
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,894
Remember when we
used to miss each other?

1410
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,091
Hey! Hey, you.

1411
01:08:34,561 --> 01:08:35,686
Yeah, what's up?

1412
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:37,240
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1413
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,840
Sadie?

1414
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,842
Sadie, the one you
chat with on the Internet.

1415
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,200
No, man. That ain't me.

1416
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,042
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1417
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:49,328
Did you make a hot list? And
not put Sadie on the hot list?

1418
01:08:49,598 --> 01:08:50,883
She was not on my list, no.

1419
01:08:51,118 --> 01:08:52,323
You know what I'm gonna do?

1420
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:53,677
I'm gonna make my own hot list.

1421
01:08:53,757 --> 01:08:56,760
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1422
01:08:56,996 --> 01:08:58,121
How does that feel?

1423
01:08:58,556 --> 01:09:00,757
It doesn't bother me. I'm
comfortable with the way I am.

1424
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:03,082
Maybe you shouldn't be
so comfortable with yourself.

1425
01:09:03,395 --> 01:09:04,759
You know why?

1426
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:07,281
You look like
a miniature Tom Petty.

1427
01:09:07,594 --> 01:09:08,924
How's that feel?

1428
01:09:09,074 --> 01:09:10,882
You think that
haircut's cool? It's not.

1429
01:09:11,154 --> 01:09:13,759
It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards.

1430
01:09:14,153 --> 01:09:15,916
Are you still
comfortable with yourself?

1431
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:18,074
Why are you wearing a tank top?

1432
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:22,122
So you can show off your little bald
pits, you little hairless wonder?

1433
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,711
Cool tank top, man.

1434
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,709
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1435
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,918
on my daughter's Facebook
page, just remember me.

1436
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,115
Remember me.

1437
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:38,475
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1438
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:39,788
Okay, I'm sorry.

1439
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:41,796
Wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey!

1440
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:43,911
Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

1441
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:45,113
Just let me go.

1442
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:46,551
Oh, my...

1443
01:09:47,786 --> 01:09:49,355
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

1444
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:51,026
I'm sorry.

1445
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:53,386
I'm not in my right head.

1446
01:09:53,465 --> 01:09:55,990
I understand. My mom's going
through menopause, too.

1447
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:57,150
It's a hard time.

1448
01:09:57,624 --> 01:09:58,829
What'd you say?

1449
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:01,268
Are you going
through menopause?

1450
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:02,543
I'm not going
through menopause.

1451
01:10:02,623 --> 01:10:05,831
I'm not gonna go through
menopause for like 20 years.

1452
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,070
I'm pregnant, you little bitch.

1453
01:10:08,262 --> 01:10:09,387
God damn it!

1454
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,311
God damn it!

1455
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,260
I'm going out with Desi to find
out if she's stealing from us.

1456
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,596
I've got the Graham Parker concert.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

1457
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:23,838
I don't know. Figure it out.

1458
01:10:29,676 --> 01:10:31,519
I kind of just wanted to talk.

1459
01:10:31,596 --> 01:10:35,396
I thought maybe we could go
to a coffeehouse or something.

1460
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:38,082
You want coffee?
This place has coffee.

1461
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:40,079
They have all kinds of drinks.

1462
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:44,043
But someplace quiet, maybe.

1463
01:10:44,357 --> 01:10:45,927
This place can be quiet.

1464
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,324
There's a spot in the back.
It's pretty quiet.

1465
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:51,360
What sport do you guys play?

1466
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:52,803
We play hockey.

1467
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:54,568
Oh, I like hockey.

1468
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,843
Who do you guys play for?

1469
01:10:56,037 --> 01:10:57,687
We play for
the Philadelphia Flyers.

1470
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:59,680
So, you guys are
all from Philadelphia?

1471
01:10:59,877 --> 01:11:01,208
No.

1472
01:11:01,277 --> 01:11:02,642
Actually, none of us are.

1473
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,408
Do you guys still
have all of your teeth?

1474
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:08,547
Well, I got all my teeth
except these ones.

1475
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,404
Do you want to try them on?

1476
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:11,804
- Yeah, I'll do it.
- Go for it.

1477
01:11:15,878 --> 01:11:17,164
Do I look sexy?

1478
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:18,444
Yeah!

1479
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:20,278
Do you want to
make out with me?

1480
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:23,083
Oh, yeah.

1481
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,687
They definitely look way better
on her than they do on you.

1482
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:31,880
Here we go.

1483
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:34,925
Thank you.

1484
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,969
So, should we go
to the quiet area?

1485
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:39,644
No, no, no.

1486
01:11:40,599 --> 01:11:41,646
Where are you going?

1487
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:44,160
We kind of have to have a little
business meeting tonight.

1488
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,446
Business meeting?

1489
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,289
Girls, you gotta celebrate because
we won tonight. Let's go.

1490
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,044
I want to party with these winners.
Come on, Deb.

1491
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,881
Just come to the stage
and dance with us.

1492
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,447
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1493
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah!

1494
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,283
Okay, let's fucking dance!

1495
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,480
Yeah!

1496
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,769
Don't be shy, feel free to come
down and fill up these empty seats.

1497
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:07,688
<i>Thank you so much for coming.
This is so exciting!</i>

1498
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:12,165
<i>For the first time
in over 30 years,</i>

1499
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,249
<i>Graham Parker & The Rumour.</i>

1500
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:58,844
Where are his fans?
I mean, where are they?

1501
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:04,289
It's hard to watch a band when you
know all of them remember D-Day.

1502
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:12,294
What was
the press turnout like?

1503
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:15,449
You're serious?

1504
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:17,966
Nobody came. Nobody.

1505
01:13:18,204 --> 01:13:19,410
Nobody is here?

1506
01:13:19,644 --> 01:13:21,453
The guy from Green Day is here.

1507
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,726
Yeah, Billie Joe,
I emailed him. He's a fan.

1508
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:25,928
You gotta get a photo
of the two of them.

1509
01:13:26,005 --> 01:13:27,609
No, he says he doesn't
want to do any press.

1510
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:29,096
He's just watching the show.

1511
01:13:29,165 --> 01:13:32,806
Oh, how punk-rock of him.
"I don't like photographs."

1512
01:13:34,045 --> 01:13:35,410
Grow up, Green Day!

1513
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:37,415
Shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck!

1514
01:13:54,846 --> 01:13:56,530
It's so good you did this.

1515
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:02,537
Pete, I wanted to let you know that I
got offered a job at Sony Records,

1516
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:03,892
and I think I'm gonna take it.

1517
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,451
I used to work for Sony.

1518
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,016
No, I know.
They love you there.

1519
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:10,813
- Who did you interview with?
- John Cleary.

1520
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:15,698
- I hired John Cleary.
- He hired me.

1521
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:16,928
What do you know?

1522
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:19,135
He only had lovely things
to say about you.

1523
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:21,972
No, he's a dick,
and he's gonna fuck you too.

1524
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:23,811
Not if I do a really good job.

1525
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:27,775
Really? I signed Pearl Jam.

1526
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,651
You don't have, like...

1527
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:23,451
I wouldn't call them
classically good dance moves,

1528
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,735
but you left it all out there.

1529
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,050
You're a blast to dance with.

1530
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,657
Thank you.

1531
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:31,615
We're having a little shindig
at the hotel after this.

1532
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:34,820
You should come by
and hang out at the hotel.

1533
01:15:36,771 --> 01:15:38,933
You want me to
come to the hotel?

1534
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:41,179
Yes, I want you to come

1535
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:43,462
by the hotel with me.

1536
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:46,814
Well, what would we do there?

1537
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:51,135
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet and
have fun and kind of see where it goes.

1538
01:15:51,332 --> 01:15:56,133
Do it like adults
do sometimes and...

1539
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,177
Like, sex?

1540
01:15:59,572 --> 01:16:02,018
I mean, if you want.

1541
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:06,536
If that's on the docket, but
I'm not trying to force that.

1542
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,814
So, you would do sex with me?

1543
01:16:09,093 --> 01:16:10,299
"Do sex"?

1544
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:12,063
What are you, Borat?

1545
01:16:12,293 --> 01:16:13,499
Are you hitting on me?

1546
01:16:13,613 --> 01:16:15,138
Yes, yes, I'm hitting on you.

1547
01:16:15,373 --> 01:16:19,059
You're hot and cool and nice
and you have beautiful eyes.

1548
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:23,019
I'm sorry.

1549
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,337
I'm married, I have two
kids and I'm pregnant.

1550
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:32,015
That is what we call
the hat-trick.

1551
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,785
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1552
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:37,660
I was just really enjoying
you being so nice to me.

1553
01:16:38,614 --> 01:16:42,016
I hope this doesn't
come off as super-cheesy,

1554
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:46,300
but I think you're
a very rare find.

1555
01:16:46,694 --> 01:16:47,980
Thank you.

1556
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:49,704
And I would totally
"do sex" with you.

1557
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,959
That was spectacular, guys.

1558
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:57,117
Really well done. Amazing.

1559
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,004
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

1560
01:16:59,955 --> 01:17:00,956
Hey, Graham.

1561
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,800
Pete. How are you, man?

1562
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:05,282
Well, the first numbers
came in.

1563
01:17:05,515 --> 01:17:07,005
Yeah, right, yeah.

1564
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:08,561
Happy? How's it looking?

1565
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:11,477
About half of your last record.

1566
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:14,116
So, you were
expecting it to sell?

1567
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:18,124
They never sell anymore. They
used to sell, but now they don't.

1568
01:17:18,435 --> 01:17:21,120
I'm not a sexy
16-year-old girl.

1569
01:17:21,355 --> 01:17:23,483
But I wanted to sell it.
It's such a good record.

1570
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,966
I feel like I let you down.

1571
01:17:25,235 --> 01:17:28,682
No, I'm gonna be fine, man.
My overheads are so low.

1572
01:17:29,075 --> 01:17:30,918
I just got a song in <i>Glee.</i>

1573
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:34,239
The guy in the wheelchair is gonna
sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.

1574
01:17:34,315 --> 01:17:36,602
I don't know, I've never seen the
show, but that's what I'm told.

1575
01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:40,003
The secret is, make sure
you have a small nut.

1576
01:17:40,475 --> 01:17:42,000
That's the key to life.

1577
01:17:42,155 --> 01:17:44,044
Graham, I don't have
small nuts, all right?

1578
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:46,157
I have big nuts and I
need to provide for them.

1579
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:48,203
Graham! Hey, what's up?

1580
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:49,396
Billie!

1581
01:17:49,475 --> 01:17:50,715
Graham, how are you doing, man?

1582
01:17:50,755 --> 01:17:52,280
- Great fucking show, man.
- Good to see you.

1583
01:17:52,355 --> 01:17:53,561
- Thank you.
- Fuck.

1584
01:17:53,675 --> 01:17:55,245
Yeah, I'm inspired.

1585
01:17:55,315 --> 01:17:56,840
I want to write
a fucking song right now.

1586
01:17:56,915 --> 01:17:57,916
- Inspired.
- Yeah.

1587
01:17:57,995 --> 01:17:59,076
That inspires me.

1588
01:17:59,155 --> 01:18:00,716
- Let's go get a drink.
- Let's get a drink.

1589
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:01,916
All right. You coming?

1590
01:18:01,995 --> 01:18:04,475
No, no, I'm fine. You guys go.

1591
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:07,083
Congratulations on <i>Glee.</i>

1592
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:08,880
Yes, thank you.

1593
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,527
All right. See you, Pete.

1594
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:12,406
- All right. So long, guys.
- Later.

1595
01:18:12,476 --> 01:18:13,557
Yeah, yeah.

1596
01:18:13,716 --> 01:18:15,559
- You got a song on *Glee?
- Yeah.

1597
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:17,883
That's killer, man.
That's so much money.

1598
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:20,357
It's great.
It's good for all of us.

1599
01:18:48,876 --> 01:18:51,197
Why did you put that
guy's teeth in your mouth?

1600
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,120
That's so gross.

1601
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:56,400
- I was drunk.
- He was dirty.

1602
01:18:56,636 --> 01:18:58,400
No, he was wearing a tie.

1603
01:18:59,076 --> 01:19:00,601
- That's true.
- He wasn't dirty.

1604
01:19:00,996 --> 01:19:04,398
When I kissed him, I felt his little
tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.

1605
01:19:04,556 --> 01:19:05,887
- You did?
- Yeah.

1606
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,527
It was like kissing a baby.

1607
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,802
French-kissing a baby.

1608
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:15,123
Can I ask you something stupid?

1609
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,085
Do you know why we're
missing money at the store?

1610
01:19:19,236 --> 01:19:20,397
Are you guys missing money?

1611
01:19:20,597 --> 01:19:22,804
Yeah. Like, $12,000.

1612
01:19:23,437 --> 01:19:24,723
Do you think that I took it?

1613
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:28,766
No. I mean... Well, no.

1614
01:19:28,877 --> 01:19:31,118
I did and I don't now.

1615
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:32,518
It's not me.

1616
01:19:32,597 --> 01:19:37,398
Why do you live in such a nice
apartment and have such a fancy car?

1617
01:19:37,757 --> 01:19:40,601
Yes, you're right. Look...

1618
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:46,519
lam an escort.

1619
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:50,448
I get paid to go out on dates.

1620
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:52,118
You...

1621
01:19:53,717 --> 01:19:56,118
But only three to
five times a year.

1622
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:57,603
Ten times, max.

1623
01:19:59,437 --> 01:20:04,728
But it's not technically prostitution,
because I don't have to sleep with them.

1624
01:20:04,957 --> 01:20:06,083
Oh, well, that's good.

1625
01:20:06,157 --> 01:20:07,204
But I always do.

1626
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:10,486
That's why I only do it
four to eight times a year.

1627
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:11,838
Fifteen times, max.

1628
01:20:13,677 --> 01:20:15,406
One year, I did it 20.

1629
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:18,362
Well, as long as
you think it's safe.

1630
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:19,603
It's safe.

1631
01:20:20,117 --> 01:20:22,643
I only do it 10
to 30 times a year.

1632
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:25,040
So, who do you
think is stealing money?

1633
01:20:26,517 --> 01:20:27,757
It's fucking Jodi.

1634
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:29,522
- No.
- Yeah.

1635
01:20:30,037 --> 01:20:31,482
She's a pilled-out whore.

1636
01:20:35,358 --> 01:20:37,804
Since you told me,
I want to tell you something.

1637
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:39,683
You're pregnant.

1638
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:41,319
How'd you know?

1639
01:20:45,598 --> 01:20:46,759
Maybe you should tell Pete.

1640
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,084
You didn't tell Pete yet?

1641
01:20:48,358 --> 01:20:49,325
I haven't told Pete.

1642
01:20:49,398 --> 01:20:50,684
- Why?
- I don't know why.

1643
01:20:50,838 --> 01:20:52,681
I just want him to want me.

1644
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:55,443
I don't want him to want me
because I'm pregnant.

1645
01:20:55,838 --> 01:20:57,522
Go home and
fucking suck his dick

1646
01:20:57,678 --> 01:20:59,362
and tell him then,
and he will love it.

1647
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:01,848
- You think?
- He'll be so excited.

1648
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:04,360
Or even better yet...
Better yet,

1649
01:21:04,638 --> 01:21:07,926
you should tell him while you're
sucking his dick, like...

1650
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:09,119
"I'm pregnant."

1651
01:21:15,878 --> 01:21:17,448
What are you doing?

1652
01:21:17,598 --> 01:21:19,441
Returning some emails.

1653
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:21,807
What time do you
have to go to work?

1654
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,727
Like, 10 minutes ago.

1655
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:25,963
Do you wanna be late?

1656
01:21:26,278 --> 01:21:28,758
No, I can't be late, not today.

1657
01:21:40,038 --> 01:21:43,042
Do you see me standing
here in front of you,

1658
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:45,359
half-naked?

1659
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:51,646
Yeah.

1660
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:53,808
And does that

1661
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,207
make you feel anything, or...

1662
01:21:57,359 --> 01:21:59,405
Come on. Are you
trying to start a fight?

1663
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:02,330
No, I'm not trying
to start a fight with you.

1664
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:03,685
I'm trying to fuck you.

1665
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:05,609
Oh, God, you know what?

1666
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,809
Today, of all days,

1667
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,241
is the day you need to
cut me a break, all right?

1668
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:11,759
Whatever.

1669
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:13,530
Oh, God.

1670
01:22:17,759 --> 01:22:18,920
What?

1671
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,810
I didn't realize
it was intentional.

1672
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:26,687
I didn't say anything because I
didn't want you to be embarrassed.

1673
01:22:26,759 --> 01:22:29,046
I thought I was being gallant.

1674
01:22:30,599 --> 01:22:32,806
All right, fine.
I'm an asshole.

1675
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:34,559
God.

1676
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:38,445
You know what your problem is?

1677
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:40,203
You're never,
ever in the moment.

1678
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:43,761
You're never, ever present.
You're never in your body.

1679
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,042
That's not true. I am in the moment.
You know how I know?

1680
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:48,883
I want to get
the fuck out of the moment.

1681
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:52,960
I swear, I can't win with you.
I just can't do it.

1682
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:54,763
You can't just walk away.

1683
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:56,285
Oh, God.

1684
01:22:56,599 --> 01:22:59,648
Hey! How's the record
company going, Pete?

1685
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,084
What? Not great.

1686
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,964
I'm still waiting
for numbers to come in.

1687
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,810
What have you heard?

1688
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,809
A couple numbers
have trickled in.

1689
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,610
It's lower than we expected.

1690
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,163
Then why are you
giving Larry money?

1691
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,681
What?

1692
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,167
I know everything.
I talked to the accountant.

1693
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,009
You know what? I don't wanna
get into some nasty fight

1694
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,605
so can we please
talk to each other

1695
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,330
the way the therapist told us
to talk to each other?

1696
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,124
Fine. Fine.

1697
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,723
It makes me feel sad
when you are dishonest.

1698
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,763
I understand it makes you feel bad
when I am dishonest with you.

1699
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,287
It hurts my feelings when
you treat me with contempt

1700
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,806
and corner me, and try
and trick me into lying.

1701
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,001
Okay.

1702
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,607
It makes me sad when it's so
easy to trick you into lying,

1703
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,682
because you're
such a lying shit-bag.

1704
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,843
That's not... You can't do
that, you can't do that.

1705
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,570
The therapist said you're
not allowed to judge me.

1706
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,882
That's not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

1707
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,085
Fair enough.

1708
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,489
Sometimes I withhold truth,
that is true.

1709
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,646
But it's only because
I'm scared to death

1710
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,049
of your crazy-assed,
illogical overreactions.

1711
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,560
Well...

1712
01:24:14,161 --> 01:24:16,641
It hurts me
inside and triggers me

1713
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,689
when you're such
a dishonest shit,

1714
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:21,412
that you're lending your father
money without telling me

1715
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,723
while your record
company's going bankrupt

1716
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:26,805
and we're on the verge
of losing our fucking house!

1717
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:42,121
What else are you lying about?

1718
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:45,841
I've taken
Viagra for two years.

1719
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:48,408
I ate six muffins
downstairs a while ago

1720
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:50,922
and my
cholesterol level is 305.

1721
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:53,443
My heart could
explode at any second.

1722
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:55,290
These might be my
very last words.

1723
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:59,124
Oh, and I gave Charlotte antibiotics
when you weren't looking.

1724
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:02,768
That's why her ear got better.
So, go fuck your witch doctor.

1725
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:07,930
What are we even doing?
What are we doing?

1726
01:25:09,241 --> 01:25:12,324
This is not making me happy.
You're not happy.

1727
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:16,083
You don't like me.
I can feel that.

1728
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:18,251
I'm not blind.

1729
01:25:18,961 --> 01:25:20,247
Jesus.

1730
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:23,042
We're like business associates.

1731
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:25,290
We're like brother and sister.

1732
01:25:25,401 --> 01:25:26,687
There's no passion there.

1733
01:25:26,842 --> 01:25:28,731
We're not like brother and sister.
You know what we're like?

1734
01:25:28,802 --> 01:25:30,213
We're like Simon and Garfunkel

1735
01:25:30,282 --> 01:25:32,205
and, somehow,
you turned me into Garfunkel.

1736
01:25:32,322 --> 01:25:33,562
I don't even know
what that means.

1737
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:34,689
Art Garfunkel.

1738
01:25:34,802 --> 01:25:38,488
What's wrong with Art Garfunkel?
He has a beautiful voice.

1739
01:25:38,642 --> 01:25:40,883
He's got an amazing voice! He
could put a harmony to anything!

1740
01:25:40,962 --> 01:25:43,442
But what I'm saying is that
you turned me into him.

1741
01:25:43,562 --> 01:25:45,087
What the hell are
you talking about?

1742
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:46,768
Simon controls him!

1743
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:50,649
That's because Simon
writes the fucking songs!

1744
01:25:51,322 --> 01:25:52,847
He's the better one!

1745
01:25:53,242 --> 01:25:54,812
You know what? I see the
way you look at our kids.

1746
01:25:54,922 --> 01:25:57,084
You have so much
love and compassion for them.

1747
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:59,324
You never look at
me like that. Ever.

1748
01:25:59,642 --> 01:26:01,565
Would we even still be together

1749
01:26:01,642 --> 01:26:03,883
if I didn't get
pregnant 14 years ago?

1750
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,291
You know what? I'm not
gonna go down that road.

1751
01:26:08,082 --> 01:26:09,447
Would we?

1752
01:26:24,122 --> 01:26:25,203
Okay.

1753
01:26:28,762 --> 01:26:31,447
You know what? I don't
want to have a party here.

1754
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:32,723
You need to cancel it.

1755
01:26:32,842 --> 01:26:33,889
No, I'm not.

1756
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:36,568
I already paid for the catering.
I've put down deposits.

1757
01:26:36,642 --> 01:26:39,327
And I sure as fuck am not gonna
call everybody back in two days

1758
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,529
when you change your mind.

1759
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,731
<i>Your girlfriend is not ugly.</i>

1760
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:53,572
Actually, Larry, she's
not my girlfriend. She's just a...

1761
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:56,934
<i>It's cool, buddy. You don't have
to explain your girlfriend to me.</i>

1762
01:26:57,685 --> 01:27:00,416
Can you please stop
licking your fingers?

1763
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:04,935
Do you know how many
germs are on your hands?

1764
01:27:05,165 --> 01:27:07,372
And you're putting
them into your mouth.

1765
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:09,209
That's gross. Stop.

1766
01:27:12,725 --> 01:27:13,806
Stop it!

1767
01:27:14,085 --> 01:27:15,496
I'm gonna kill you!

1768
01:27:15,565 --> 01:27:17,329
Hey! Sadie, enough, all right?

1769
01:27:17,405 --> 01:27:18,452
She isn't hurting anyone.

1770
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,175
You want to say something,
just keep your mouth shut.

1771
01:27:20,285 --> 01:27:21,855
You have never been nice to her

1772
01:27:21,925 --> 01:27:23,495
and now she's getting
aggressive with you.

1773
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:25,852
I told you this would happen.

1774
01:27:33,045 --> 01:27:35,286
I'm sick of everybody fighting.

1775
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:18,732
What do you think you're gonna
be like when you grow up?

1776
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:22,534
I don't know.

1777
01:28:24,445 --> 01:28:25,970
I don't know.

1778
01:28:26,485 --> 01:28:28,647
Do you think you want kids?

1779
01:28:28,765 --> 01:28:30,255
Just one.

1780
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,611
Just one, why?

1781
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:36,493
Because if I have two, then the other
will fight with the other one.

1782
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:39,851
Does it make you
sad when you fight?

1783
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:43,016
I don't want anyone to fight.

1784
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:51,526
I love you.

1785
01:29:21,165 --> 01:29:24,886
Why isn't anybody talking?
Why is it so quiet?

1786
01:29:27,965 --> 01:29:30,093
It's the <i>Sounds of Silence.</i>

1787
01:30:00,565 --> 01:30:02,169
Will you stop, Dad?

1788
01:30:06,045 --> 01:30:08,047
How many of those
are you gonna eat?

1789
01:30:08,245 --> 01:30:09,735
As many as I want.

1790
01:30:10,045 --> 01:30:11,490
I'm gonna tell Mom on you.

1791
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:13,528
Try it. See what
you get for Christmas.

1792
01:30:13,885 --> 01:30:14,932
Nothing.

1793
01:30:16,485 --> 01:30:18,772
Snitches wind up in ditches.

1794
01:30:19,085 --> 01:30:20,610
Remember that.

1795
01:30:25,765 --> 01:30:26,926
Hey, Peter.

1796
01:30:27,085 --> 01:30:28,450
- Hi.
- Hiya.

1797
01:30:32,765 --> 01:30:34,574
All right. See you.

1798
01:30:35,445 --> 01:30:36,651
Have a good one.

1799
01:30:37,245 --> 01:30:38,406
Peter.

1800
01:30:38,485 --> 01:30:39,566
Peter!

1801
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:42,612
Hi.

1802
01:30:42,845 --> 01:30:43,846
Catherine.

1803
01:30:43,925 --> 01:30:45,006
I'm Joseph's mother.

1804
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:47,447
Oh, right. No, I know.
Hi, Catherine.

1805
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,932
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.

1806
01:30:50,605 --> 01:30:51,686
Sorry.

1807
01:30:51,965 --> 01:30:53,455
Hello, Joseph.

1808
01:30:54,805 --> 01:30:57,285
I hear our kids have
been chatting online.

1809
01:30:57,605 --> 01:31:00,336
Yeah? I heard that your wife
has been screaming at my son.

1810
01:31:00,405 --> 01:31:02,055
- And I don't appreciate it.
- Excuse me?

1811
01:31:02,285 --> 01:31:03,969
She screamed at my son.

1812
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:07,129
Right? She threatened you.
She screamed at you. She cursed at him.

1813
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:09,535
He's 13 years old,
for God's sake.

1814
01:31:09,605 --> 01:31:11,209
What the hell is
the matter with her?

1815
01:31:11,285 --> 01:31:13,245
Okay, you better check
her meds and get 'em right.

1816
01:31:14,525 --> 01:31:17,813
Okay, you know what? Why
don't you back the fuck off?

1817
01:31:17,925 --> 01:31:20,656
Because that's my lovely, sweet
wife you're talking about.

1818
01:31:20,805 --> 01:31:22,534
- Oh, I need to back off?
- Yeah, you need to back off.

1819
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:25,296
Because your kid is an animal.
He's a fucking animal.

1820
01:31:25,365 --> 01:31:26,526
Why don't you
put him on a leash?

1821
01:31:26,605 --> 01:31:28,528
Turn around,
turn around, turn around!

1822
01:31:28,765 --> 01:31:30,096
If he insults my
daughter again,

1823
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:31,576
I'm gonna hit him
with my fucking car.

1824
01:31:31,645 --> 01:31:32,692
Got it?

1825
01:31:32,845 --> 01:31:35,086
In fact, if you insult my wife
again, you know what I'm gonna do?

1826
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:36,974
I'm gonna show up at your
house when you're sleeping

1827
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:39,776
and I'll take your iPad
or your iPod or your iMac

1828
01:31:39,845 --> 01:31:41,495
and I'll shove them
up your fucking iCunt.

1829
01:31:41,765 --> 01:31:44,496
I got nothing to lose.
Your kid is the problem.

1830
01:31:44,685 --> 01:31:46,369
- My kid is a fucking angel.
- Turn around.

1831
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:48,295
I don't have
time for this shit.

1832
01:31:48,645 --> 01:31:51,694
So I'm keeping it together, but if
I wasn't at school right now...

1833
01:31:53,365 --> 01:31:55,413
Touch my... Touch me?

1834
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,688
- I didn't touch your...
- You touched my upper breast.

1835
01:31:57,765 --> 01:31:59,927
I didn't. I didn't. I got
right below your shoulder.

1836
01:32:00,005 --> 01:32:02,770
You got right here. You actually...
He hit my nipple.

1837
01:32:02,845 --> 01:32:03,892
You what?

1838
01:32:03,965 --> 01:32:05,091
You're insane.

1839
01:32:05,165 --> 01:32:07,008
Why would you do that? Did you
just touch my mom's nipple?

1840
01:32:07,085 --> 01:32:09,531
He just touched my nipple.
Why would you do that to me?

1841
01:32:09,645 --> 01:32:10,771
I poked you on the shoulder.

1842
01:32:10,845 --> 01:32:12,210
I have very high nipples.

1843
01:32:12,445 --> 01:32:13,446
I touched your shirt.

1844
01:32:13,525 --> 01:32:14,925
What do you think
is under my shirt?

1845
01:32:15,005 --> 01:32:16,370
I just... My breasts
are under my shirt.

1846
01:32:16,405 --> 01:32:18,169
- Your shoulder. Your shoulder.
- He just touched my breast.

1847
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:21,050
Well, that's a funny place to
put a shoulder, on my boob.

1848
01:32:21,205 --> 01:32:23,253
Hello? There are
children around.

1849
01:32:23,365 --> 01:32:26,289
This isn't over. This is not over.
You're gonna be sorry.

1850
01:32:26,365 --> 01:32:28,367
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1851
01:32:28,845 --> 01:32:31,212
And why the fuck
would you believe Desi?

1852
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,209
You just admitted it.

1853
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:34,726
Did I?

1854
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:39,413
You stole $12,000 from me, Jodi,
and I need you to pay me back.

1855
01:32:39,565 --> 01:32:41,806
Could you at least
give me a referral?

1856
01:32:41,885 --> 01:32:45,571
You babysat my kids
while you were on OxyContin.

1857
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:46,726
Oxycodone.

1858
01:32:46,885 --> 01:32:48,091
Well, oxycodone.

1859
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:49,291
Oxycotton.

1860
01:32:49,405 --> 01:32:50,452
OxyContin?

1861
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:51,566
Oxykitten.

1862
01:32:51,645 --> 01:32:52,931
What's Oxykitten?

1863
01:32:53,325 --> 01:32:54,326
Meow.

1864
01:32:54,405 --> 01:32:58,376
Jodi, you put me in danger.
Me and my family.

1865
01:32:58,565 --> 01:33:00,408
It was a cry for help.

1866
01:33:00,765 --> 01:33:02,893
Help. Help.

1867
01:33:03,405 --> 01:33:05,009
Why don't you help me?

1868
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:07,373
Why don't you help me?
Just help.

1869
01:33:07,645 --> 01:33:08,976
Just help.

1870
01:33:12,245 --> 01:33:13,610
You didn't help me.

1871
01:33:13,885 --> 01:33:15,410
Are you high right now?

1872
01:33:15,565 --> 01:33:17,488
Help me.

1873
01:33:20,325 --> 01:33:22,851
Is that about me?
Is that the cops?

1874
01:33:23,325 --> 01:33:24,486
Is this a set-up?

1875
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:25,805
I need to go.

1876
01:33:26,245 --> 01:33:27,531
Okay, see you later.

1877
01:33:28,805 --> 01:33:30,853
Fuck you, Debbie.

1878
01:33:31,045 --> 01:33:32,570
Fuck you.

1879
01:33:33,445 --> 01:33:35,891
Could you see it in your heart
to lend me some money?

1880
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:40,249
- I would love to lend you money, but...
- Thank you.

1881
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,493
- I mean, there's no way I could.
- Why?

1882
01:33:43,045 --> 01:33:46,731
I just wouldn't wanna
jeopardize a relationship

1883
01:33:46,805 --> 01:33:50,605
with somebody that I care
about by giving them money.

1884
01:33:51,005 --> 01:33:52,495
I mean, look how far we've come

1885
01:33:52,565 --> 01:33:56,570
that you could come to me for advice
and be able to ask me to borrow money.

1886
01:33:57,045 --> 01:34:00,333
Let me ask you a question. Who do
you like better Simon or Garfunkel?

1887
01:34:00,405 --> 01:34:02,806
- Garfunkel.
- Really? Garfunkel?

1888
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:04,808
Yeah, he's got
the voice of an angel.

1889
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:09,095
He's got a great voice, but what about Simon?
He wrote the songs.

1890
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:13,693
Who cares? Everybody writes songs.
How many singers are there?

1891
01:34:13,805 --> 01:34:17,651
Simon's a good singer, too. Art
Garfunkel is a choir all in one man.

1892
01:34:17,725 --> 01:34:20,456
Have you ever hear Paul Simon sing
<i>Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>

1893
01:34:20,525 --> 01:34:24,974
in concert by himself? It's a nightmare.
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

1894
01:34:25,805 --> 01:34:28,172
Is there a chance I'm just
wrong about everything?

1895
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,894
Definitely. Of course.
Absolutely.

1896
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,973
Joseph was very upset when
I spoke to him about this.

1897
01:34:35,763 --> 01:34:38,494
So I thought it
was important that we

1898
01:34:39,243 --> 01:34:40,927
join together and
work this through.

1899
01:34:41,003 --> 01:34:42,164
Absolutely.

1900
01:34:42,603 --> 01:34:45,049
We're gonna work through it,

1901
01:34:45,123 --> 01:34:48,684
but Debbie told my son that
he looked like Tom Petty,

1902
01:34:49,323 --> 01:34:50,370
in a negative way.

1903
01:34:50,763 --> 01:34:52,845
Who's Tom Petty? You
know who Tom Petty is.

1904
01:34:53,763 --> 01:34:57,245
And she said that if she had to
come back that she was going to...

1905
01:34:57,443 --> 01:35:01,209
"F" up his pussy-ass,
which is what she said.

1906
01:35:01,283 --> 01:35:02,409
Oh, my...

1907
01:35:02,803 --> 01:35:04,043
Are you serious?

1908
01:35:04,403 --> 01:35:07,486
I didn't. I would never.
To a child?

1909
01:35:08,243 --> 01:35:13,204
Your son has been defiling my daughter's
Facebook page now for months.

1910
01:35:13,763 --> 01:35:15,253
These people are liars.

1911
01:35:15,403 --> 01:35:17,132
He said that my
son was an animal

1912
01:35:17,203 --> 01:35:18,932
and that if I didn't
keep him on a leash,

1913
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,812
that he would hit
him with his car.

1914
01:35:21,243 --> 01:35:22,529
Did you say that?

1915
01:35:22,603 --> 01:35:23,764
That's ridiculous.

1916
01:35:24,003 --> 01:35:25,448
- Who talks like that?
- You do.

1917
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:27,446
- He didn't say that.
- He said it to me.

1918
01:35:27,523 --> 01:35:31,414
No. What I said was that we need
to keep an extra eye on our kids

1919
01:35:31,483 --> 01:35:34,168
because with all
the technological advances,

1920
01:35:34,243 --> 01:35:36,325
they need to learn to
use them responsibly.

1921
01:35:36,443 --> 01:35:39,765
No. What he said to me was...
He called me an iCunt.

1922
01:35:39,963 --> 01:35:41,249
- A what?
- Language, Catherine! Language.

1923
01:35:41,323 --> 01:35:42,370
I'm quoting!

1924
01:35:42,563 --> 01:35:43,849
How am I gonna relay

1925
01:35:43,923 --> 01:35:46,608
what these two nutballs
said to me, unless I say it?

1926
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,733
Can you please not
talk like that, Catherine?

1927
01:35:48,803 --> 01:35:50,214
<i>Music Man</i> is
rehearsing next door.

1928
01:35:50,283 --> 01:35:52,331
Sorry, fucking <i>Music Man.</i>

1929
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:55,886
Maybe if I looked more like
this fake bullshit couple.

1930
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:57,567
Looks like they're
in a bank commercial.

1931
01:35:57,723 --> 01:35:58,884
That's what you look like.

1932
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,244
Like you're a bullshit
bank commercial couple.

1933
01:36:01,483 --> 01:36:04,054
None of this
talk is productive.

1934
01:36:04,123 --> 01:36:07,127
I would like to rear up
and jackknife my legs

1935
01:36:07,283 --> 01:36:10,127
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

1936
01:36:10,483 --> 01:36:12,372
You're just really scaring me.

1937
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:14,286
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

1938
01:36:14,483 --> 01:36:16,690
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

1939
01:36:16,843 --> 01:36:18,174
I'll chew through you.

1940
01:36:18,323 --> 01:36:19,734
Catherine,
you're better than this.

1941
01:36:19,803 --> 01:36:22,409
Fuck you, Jill. You're a
horrible fucking woman.

1942
01:36:22,603 --> 01:36:24,651
This is why everybody
hates you, Jill.

1943
01:36:24,723 --> 01:36:29,172
This kind of shit. Ineffective.
Fucking bullshit hair.

1944
01:36:30,443 --> 01:36:32,571
And I'm glad your husband died.

1945
01:36:32,763 --> 01:36:35,687
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

1946
01:36:36,283 --> 01:36:38,809
Okay, Catherine, I think we
know what's happening now.

1947
01:36:39,323 --> 01:36:41,769
Now you know what
we're dealing with.

1948
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:26,931
I'm not gonna eat that chicken.

1949
01:37:27,043 --> 01:37:28,249
Why not?

1950
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:31,165
Because I feel like I'm
gonna be a vegetarian.

1951
01:37:31,363 --> 01:37:33,184
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?

1952
01:37:33,763 --> 01:37:36,289
You guys
have been reading my texts?

1953
01:37:36,763 --> 01:37:38,606
- No, we haven't.
- Yes, we have.

1954
01:37:38,683 --> 01:37:40,447
We're supposed to
keep an eye on you.

1955
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:41,610
How did you find out?

1956
01:37:41,803 --> 01:37:44,807
Joseph told me that you flipped
out on him and his mom.

1957
01:37:45,003 --> 01:37:47,051
And you guys are nuts,
and I agree.

1958
01:37:47,323 --> 01:37:49,087
All right, you know what?
Don't be disrespectful.

1959
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,853
You're the ones
who are disrespectful.

1960
01:37:50,923 --> 01:37:53,085
Reading my texts is like
reading my diary.

1961
01:37:53,163 --> 01:37:55,325
And you were really
sweet on your iChats.

1962
01:37:55,403 --> 01:37:56,404
We were really proud of you.

1963
01:37:56,483 --> 01:37:58,690
Yeah, we were going to give you
your computer and phone back.

1964
01:37:58,763 --> 01:37:59,810
Fuck you!

1965
01:38:00,403 --> 01:38:02,804
Okay, there's the first
official "fuck you."

1966
01:38:02,883 --> 01:38:05,727
Okay, that is not how we talk
to each other in this house.

1967
01:38:05,803 --> 01:38:09,091
You guys talk to each other
like that all the time.

1968
01:38:09,243 --> 01:38:12,884
And to Joseph and his mom.
You made Joseph cry.

1969
01:38:13,244 --> 01:38:16,771
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.

1970
01:38:17,004 --> 01:38:18,290
Shut up, Charlotte.

1971
01:38:19,084 --> 01:38:23,214
You guys so desperately want me to be
so perfect and to make no mistakes.

1972
01:38:23,284 --> 01:38:25,127
Well, you two
are fucking insane.

1973
01:38:25,324 --> 01:38:26,371
Okay.

1974
01:38:26,444 --> 01:38:29,448
All you do is fight, or you don't
fight, which is even worse

1975
01:38:29,524 --> 01:38:31,564
because it looks like you
hate each other for weeks.

1976
01:38:31,884 --> 01:38:34,171
You obsess over
every little thing I do,

1977
01:38:34,404 --> 01:38:36,532
and you don't trust
in me or believe in me.

1978
01:38:36,604 --> 01:38:38,129
Well, I'm fucking sick of it.

1979
01:38:38,844 --> 01:38:41,814
Yeah, I said "fuck."
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1980
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:45,731
Ground me forever, I don't care.
I don't care about anything.

1981
01:38:47,324 --> 01:38:49,167
I hate everything.

1982
01:38:49,644 --> 01:38:53,205
Everyone's going crazy. I don't
care if I have no friends.

1983
01:38:54,044 --> 01:38:56,046
Are you still upset about <i>Lost?</i>

1984
01:38:56,124 --> 01:38:57,694
Of course I'm upset about <i>Lost!</i>

1985
01:38:57,764 --> 01:39:01,405
You guys took away my shit before I
could watch the last two episodes.

1986
01:39:01,924 --> 01:39:04,404
And I don't know
what the fuck happened!

1987
01:39:08,564 --> 01:39:10,487
She's becoming just like us.

1988
01:39:11,484 --> 01:39:15,569
I hope I never get my period
if this is what happens.

1989
01:39:28,564 --> 01:39:29,850
Where did you find this?

1990
01:39:30,644 --> 01:39:32,009
I stole it.

1991
01:39:37,724 --> 01:39:39,055
Thank you.

1992
01:39:40,604 --> 01:39:42,015
No big deal.

1993
01:39:45,524 --> 01:39:47,526
Our kids are fucking crazy.

1994
01:39:47,684 --> 01:39:49,209
And it's our fault.

1995
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:52,294
Do you think there's anything we
can do to turn it around, or...

1996
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:55,409
Sadie's 13. She might
be a lost cause.

1997
01:39:55,644 --> 01:39:57,646
Where did she learn
that kind of language?

1998
01:39:57,764 --> 01:39:59,129
We don't talk like that.

1999
01:39:59,204 --> 01:40:00,410
I have no fucking idea.

2000
01:40:01,044 --> 01:40:03,809
Do you think Sadie
is this crazy because of us

2001
01:40:03,884 --> 01:40:06,535
or is it hormones and <i>Lost?</i>

2002
01:40:06,964 --> 01:40:08,375
J. J. Abrams.

2003
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:11,046
- He's ruining our daughter.
- Yeah.

2004
01:40:11,524 --> 01:40:13,094
That fucking geek.

2005
01:40:13,284 --> 01:40:16,049
I feel bad for us.
I feel bad for us.

2006
01:40:16,204 --> 01:40:19,572
All of a sudden, we're like
a magnet for negativity.

2007
01:40:20,004 --> 01:40:22,211
Why do people
keep attacking us?

2008
01:40:22,684 --> 01:40:25,813
What did we do?
We're just doing our best.

2009
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:27,844
Should we talk about our fight?

2010
01:40:28,404 --> 01:40:30,213
I think we're
under enough pressure.

2011
01:40:30,284 --> 01:40:33,128
Let's just let
it go, this time.

2012
01:40:33,884 --> 01:40:34,965
Yeah.

2013
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:36,575
We can give each other a break.

2014
01:40:36,684 --> 01:40:38,652
All right, great. Thank you.

2015
01:40:38,804 --> 01:40:41,330
And I'm sorry about my dad.
You're right.

2016
01:40:42,764 --> 01:40:46,735
I'm sorry that he's just
an endless mooch.

2017
01:40:47,804 --> 01:40:50,410
The truth is that
this isn't about us.

2018
01:40:50,764 --> 01:40:52,209
It's about our parents.

2019
01:40:52,404 --> 01:40:54,884
We're not even mad at each other.
We're mad at them.

2020
01:40:54,964 --> 01:40:56,728
Exactly. Exactly.

2021
01:40:57,004 --> 01:41:00,087
Let's just take away our
parents' power by loving them.

2022
01:41:01,004 --> 01:41:02,085
Can we do that?

2023
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:03,774
Yes.

2024
01:41:04,004 --> 01:41:05,130
Thank God.

2025
01:41:05,844 --> 01:41:07,926
I kind of feel
better already, do you?

2026
01:41:08,284 --> 01:41:09,695
- Do you?
- I do.

2027
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:11,653
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

2028
01:41:16,684 --> 01:41:18,449
It's not us, it's them.

2029
01:41:18,884 --> 01:41:20,124
Totally.

2030
01:41:31,964 --> 01:41:33,728
What are you doing? We have
to get ready for the party.

2031
01:41:33,804 --> 01:41:36,535
I just watched
the last episode of <i>Lost.</i>

2032
01:41:38,244 --> 01:41:39,370
Okay.

2033
01:41:39,804 --> 01:41:42,694
You know what? We don't have
time for this right now.

2034
01:41:42,804 --> 01:41:44,204
We have a lot of
people coming over.

2035
01:41:44,324 --> 01:41:45,610
They're all dead.

2036
01:41:46,164 --> 01:41:47,165
What?

2037
01:41:47,644 --> 01:41:51,171
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...

2038
01:41:51,365 --> 01:41:54,494
- I don't care about the show right now.
- Jin, Sun...

2039
01:41:54,685 --> 01:41:57,256
Okay? I need you to just get
in the shower, get dressed.

2040
01:41:57,325 --> 01:41:58,531
- Let's just put it on hold.
- Walt, Juliet...

2041
01:41:58,845 --> 01:42:00,449
All those people.

2042
01:42:00,605 --> 01:42:01,936
Don't think about <i>Lost</i> today.

2043
01:42:02,005 --> 01:42:05,009
Tomorrow, <i>Lost,</i> all day.
I can't wait to hear about it.

2044
01:42:05,205 --> 01:42:08,493
Jack? No way, really?
Right now, shower.

2045
01:42:08,725 --> 01:42:11,171
I don't make fun of
your stupid <i>Mad Men.</i>

2046
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:13,732
First of all, I don't get
worked up over <i>Mad Men.</i>

2047
01:42:13,925 --> 01:42:15,450
That's because Mad Men sucks.

2048
01:42:15,525 --> 01:42:17,448
What Don Draper
has gone through

2049
01:42:17,525 --> 01:42:20,529
beats whatever Jack is running
from on some fucking island.

2050
01:42:20,605 --> 01:42:23,415
Bunch of people smoking in an office.
It's stupid.

2051
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:26,212
It's about a lot more than that.
And you don't have any kind

2052
01:42:26,285 --> 01:42:28,811
of understanding about what
it was like in the '60s.

2053
01:42:28,885 --> 01:42:30,933
You do cry during Mad Men.

2054
01:42:31,045 --> 01:42:35,414
- I don't cry over it. I appreciate it.
- Right.

2055
01:42:35,485 --> 01:42:37,453
You're getting me off topic.

2056
01:42:37,605 --> 01:42:39,653
Just, please, get dressed.

2057
01:42:44,365 --> 01:42:46,174
- Hello.
- Hi.

2058
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:47,485
I'm glad you're here.

2059
01:42:47,645 --> 01:42:49,488
I need a buffer
in case it gets weird.

2060
01:42:49,605 --> 01:42:51,573
Oh, well, I'm ready to buff.

2061
01:42:52,045 --> 01:42:54,013
- Let's buff. Okay.
- Grab these napkins.

2062
01:42:57,525 --> 01:43:01,007
So, that's the girl
who works for you.

2063
01:43:01,165 --> 01:43:03,486
- Yeah. That's her.
- Works for Debbie.

2064
01:43:03,605 --> 01:43:05,016
She seems nice.

2065
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:07,532
My wife would never let me
have a hot employee like that.

2066
01:43:07,685 --> 01:43:08,766
- Yeah?
- No.

2067
01:43:08,885 --> 01:43:10,614
Every woman who works for us

2068
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:14,127
looks like they've been in some
kind of horrible accident.

2069
01:43:14,925 --> 01:43:17,576
I'm taking control,
and now you're my slave.

2070
01:43:19,405 --> 01:43:22,056
Are you comfortable with that
around your husband?

2071
01:43:22,605 --> 01:43:25,529
Pete wouldn't know
what to do with that.

2072
01:43:25,925 --> 01:43:27,529
Do you think our wives are
looking at us right now?

2073
01:43:27,605 --> 01:43:29,016
- Oh, definitely.
- Yeah.

2074
01:43:29,405 --> 01:43:31,453
They look like pedophiles.

2075
01:43:37,005 --> 01:43:39,326
Thank you. The girls are
so excited you're here.

2076
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:40,492
They're all outside.

2077
01:43:40,565 --> 01:43:41,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

2078
01:43:42,165 --> 01:43:44,054
- Hey, how are you?
- How are you, man?

2079
01:43:44,165 --> 01:43:45,326
Good to see you.

2080
01:43:45,405 --> 01:43:46,645
Happy birthday, Pete.

2081
01:43:46,725 --> 01:43:47,851
How wonderful to see you.

2082
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:49,086
Thank you, Grandma Molly.

2083
01:43:49,205 --> 01:43:50,286
You're wonderful.

2084
01:43:50,445 --> 01:43:54,166
And look at my gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

2085
01:43:54,405 --> 01:43:57,056
No, I get that. I'm just
wondering why I should do it.

2086
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:58,206
Pete, Jason's here.

2087
01:43:58,285 --> 01:43:59,332
Peter, hi.

2088
01:43:59,645 --> 01:44:00,726
Hey, how's it going, Jason?

2089
01:44:00,805 --> 01:44:02,534
- You look well.
- Thank you.

2090
01:44:02,845 --> 01:44:04,805
How do you like what I've
been doing to your girl?

2091
01:44:04,845 --> 01:44:06,529
How you like
Debbie's "after" body?

2092
01:44:06,845 --> 01:44:08,005
It's nice. Come on. Show him.

2093
01:44:08,645 --> 01:44:10,329
Look at this. It's beautiful.

2094
01:44:10,405 --> 01:44:13,375
Look at that "after" ass.
Now, it starts here.

2095
01:44:13,965 --> 01:44:16,013
But it used to start here.

2096
01:44:16,525 --> 01:44:18,289
And I brought it up.

2097
01:44:19,325 --> 01:44:20,815
You're welcome.

2098
01:44:20,965 --> 01:44:22,854
So, are you a trainer?

2099
01:44:23,445 --> 01:44:25,015
Yes.

2100
01:44:25,205 --> 01:44:28,607
But not just physical. Spiritual.
I'm sort of a guide.

2101
01:44:29,425 --> 01:44:32,889
You guys should talk.
I think you'll get along.

2102
01:44:34,485 --> 01:44:35,486
Come here, honey.
I gotta tell you something.

2103
01:44:35,565 --> 01:44:36,646
Yeah.

2104
01:44:45,965 --> 01:44:47,615
- Who's that in the pool?
- Mine.

2105
01:44:51,165 --> 01:44:52,974
- Hello.
- Hello, Debbie.

2106
01:44:53,045 --> 01:44:54,331
- How are you?
- Good.

2107
01:44:54,845 --> 01:44:56,609
Remember my husband, Pete?

2108
01:44:56,765 --> 01:45:00,008
Oh, right. I didn't recognize
you with the long hair.

2109
01:45:00,085 --> 01:45:02,531
Oh, yeah. I've been growing it.

2110
01:45:02,685 --> 01:45:03,925
Happy birthday.

2111
01:45:04,005 --> 01:45:05,530
Thank you so much.

2112
01:45:05,605 --> 01:45:06,686
Very old Scotch.

2113
01:45:06,765 --> 01:45:08,494
You know...

2114
01:45:08,645 --> 01:45:09,885
I hope it hasn't expired.

2115
01:45:11,485 --> 01:45:13,533
No, Scotch doesn't expire.

2116
01:45:13,925 --> 01:45:15,734
It improves with age.

2117
01:45:17,485 --> 01:45:20,216
Yeah. No, I know.
Thank you so...

2118
01:45:20,325 --> 01:45:22,407
That's nice. Come on in. Sure.

2119
01:45:22,485 --> 01:45:23,532
Sorry.

2120
01:45:26,766 --> 01:45:29,610
So, what do you do
in Chino, Oliver?

2121
01:45:29,686 --> 01:45:30,687
I'm a surgeon.

2122
01:45:30,806 --> 01:45:32,217
- What kind?
- That's great.

2123
01:45:33,086 --> 01:45:34,895
Mainly of the spine.

2124
01:45:35,206 --> 01:45:38,415
My specialty is
scoliosis surgery.

2125
01:45:38,726 --> 01:45:42,492
My mom used to talk to me
like I had scoliosis

2126
01:45:42,566 --> 01:45:45,172
because I'm a little hunchy,
but that's a different thing.

2127
01:45:45,406 --> 01:45:47,056
Well, you definitely
don't look right.

2128
01:45:47,206 --> 01:45:48,617
- Hey!
- Hey!

2129
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,416
Sorry we're late.

2130
01:45:50,486 --> 01:45:52,409
I was in the lab,
cloning myself.

2131
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:54,615
We're gonna have
another seven tomorrow.

2132
01:45:54,886 --> 01:45:57,969
We cut their hair differently, so
we can finally tell who they are.

2133
01:45:58,086 --> 01:45:59,895
You like the new
haircut, Travis?

2134
01:46:00,126 --> 01:46:01,457
I'm Jack, damn it!

2135
01:46:01,526 --> 01:46:03,130
Of course.

2136
01:46:03,246 --> 01:46:04,850
Larry, this is my father.

2137
01:46:05,406 --> 01:46:07,215
Really? How are you?

2138
01:46:08,526 --> 01:46:10,016
- Oliver.
- Oliver?

2139
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:12,489
"Can I have some more?"

2140
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:15,251
"Please, Oliver?
I need a little more, sir."

2141
01:46:15,326 --> 01:46:18,614
I love that movie. You must
get that all the time.

2142
01:46:18,846 --> 01:46:20,894
- Not really.
- My nose itches right here.

2143
01:46:21,086 --> 01:46:23,737
I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm
Claire and I'm Larry's wife.

2144
01:46:23,806 --> 01:46:26,696
Very nice to see you,
but I'm gonna go get the kids.

2145
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:29,612
We won't see her
now for the whole day.

2146
01:46:29,766 --> 01:46:32,087
I'd help, honey, but you know
I got the blood pressure,

2147
01:46:32,166 --> 01:46:33,292
and I don't want to.

2148
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:34,607
Can I get you a drink, Dad?

2149
01:46:34,686 --> 01:46:36,176
Yeah, a little white wine.

2150
01:46:36,406 --> 01:46:37,487
- White wine?
- Yeah.

2151
01:46:37,606 --> 01:46:39,176
- Heavy stuff.
- Yeah.

2152
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:42,572
So, who knew that
Debbie had a dad?

2153
01:46:42,926 --> 01:46:44,815
Where have you
been for 15 years?

2154
01:46:44,886 --> 01:46:48,686
Never seen you at Hanukah or
Christmas or Ramadan, nothing.

2155
01:46:48,766 --> 01:46:51,053
How you get out of all that stuff?
Do you have a wife?

2156
01:46:51,126 --> 01:46:52,696
Yeah, my wife's at home.

2157
01:46:52,806 --> 01:46:54,012
Why didn't she come?

2158
01:46:54,086 --> 01:46:56,327
Construction.
They're sanding our deck.

2159
01:46:56,486 --> 01:46:57,976
You let the woman
sand the deck?

2160
01:46:58,286 --> 01:46:59,776
She supervises it. Yes.

2161
01:47:00,286 --> 01:47:01,333
Okay.

2162
01:47:01,446 --> 01:47:02,447
Hey, guys.

2163
01:47:02,566 --> 01:47:06,457
Hey! Look how big the kids are!

2164
01:47:06,806 --> 01:47:08,217
Sadie!

2165
01:47:09,286 --> 01:47:11,095
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sadie.

2166
01:47:11,646 --> 01:47:14,411
Mom. Who's Oliver?

2167
01:47:14,606 --> 01:47:15,653
What do you mean?

2168
01:47:16,126 --> 01:47:17,207
Is he your dad?

2169
01:47:17,326 --> 01:47:19,567
Is he my...
He's my biological father.

2170
01:47:20,966 --> 01:47:22,331
What does that mean?

2171
01:47:22,806 --> 01:47:25,935
It means that my mom,
Grandma...

2172
01:47:26,126 --> 01:47:29,175
He and my mom had a baby,
and that was me.

2173
01:47:29,486 --> 01:47:31,170
Oh, so you're our grandpa?

2174
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:33,896
Well, why don't
you ask your mother?

2175
01:47:34,006 --> 01:47:35,849
Yeah. I guess so.

2176
01:47:35,926 --> 01:47:38,088
Then that would make him
your grandfather then, yes.

2177
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:39,492
Do you want him to be?

2178
01:47:39,566 --> 01:47:41,409
Yes, then we get
another grandpa.

2179
01:47:41,486 --> 01:47:42,726
Come on.

2180
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:43,807
Well...

2181
01:47:44,206 --> 01:47:46,607
- Another grandpa.
- Trampoline time.

2182
01:47:48,646 --> 01:47:50,853
That was deeply uncomfortable.

2183
01:47:52,086 --> 01:47:55,727
At least that pretty girl was
here to divert our attention.

2184
01:48:12,926 --> 01:48:14,132
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

2185
01:48:14,326 --> 01:48:16,010
Me, oh, my.
I did not see you there.

2186
01:48:16,086 --> 01:48:17,576
- Hi.
- I saw you there.

2187
01:48:17,726 --> 01:48:20,696
Did you guys come together?
Are you a couple?

2188
01:48:22,766 --> 01:48:25,007
- No, we didn't come together.
- No, absolutely not.

2189
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:28,729
I'm sorry, I thought...
The moustache is a little...

2190
01:48:28,926 --> 01:48:31,008
- That's fair.
- I just assumed.

2191
01:48:31,086 --> 01:48:33,168
This is
a straight-man moustache.

2192
01:48:33,406 --> 01:48:36,888
What is the difference between
a gay man's moustache

2193
01:48:37,286 --> 01:48:38,731
and a straight man's moustache?

2194
01:48:38,886 --> 01:48:40,251
The smell.

2195
01:48:43,406 --> 01:48:44,896
Excuse me.

2196
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:52,930
So, spinal surgery.

2197
01:48:53,006 --> 01:48:57,170
It just seems to me to be at
the top of the surgery chain.

2198
01:48:57,366 --> 01:49:00,415
Well, we're not
cardio, we're not neuro,

2199
01:49:00,926 --> 01:49:04,533
but I like to think we're an
important part of the spectrum.

2200
01:49:04,767 --> 01:49:06,656
- Do you operate every single day?
- Most days.

2201
01:49:06,807 --> 01:49:07,933
Multiple times a day?

2202
01:49:08,247 --> 01:49:09,328
Three, four times.

2203
01:49:09,887 --> 01:49:12,936
So, what's the price range?
Like, if I wanted a...

2204
01:49:13,447 --> 01:49:15,176
I'd rather not say.

2205
01:49:15,607 --> 01:49:18,133
It's so big,
you're embarrassed to say.

2206
01:49:18,447 --> 01:49:19,937
I wouldn't say "embarrassed."

2207
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:22,294
- Are there hunchbacks today?
- Of course.

2208
01:49:22,367 --> 01:49:23,448
I've never seen one.

2209
01:49:23,527 --> 01:49:25,734
Well, that's because
there are spinal surgeons.

2210
01:49:25,847 --> 01:49:26,848
That's because of you.

2211
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:28,736
Each time I don't
see a hunchback,

2212
01:49:28,807 --> 01:49:30,297
you're getting
that much richer.

2213
01:49:32,047 --> 01:49:33,287
You like The Beatles,
don't you?

2214
01:49:34,567 --> 01:49:35,693
- Who doesn't like The Beatles?
- Nobody.

2215
01:49:35,767 --> 01:49:36,768
No, nobody.

2216
01:49:38,847 --> 01:49:40,491
So funny. You're so funny.

2217
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:42,252
What is your sun sign?

2218
01:49:42,727 --> 01:49:44,058
- Libra.
- Oh, boy.

2219
01:49:44,127 --> 01:49:45,731
- That's not good.
- No, sir.

2220
01:49:45,807 --> 01:49:47,567
That's not good. Not for
me, that's not good.

2221
01:49:47,607 --> 01:49:49,416
Sexually, we're
completely incompatible.

2222
01:49:49,527 --> 01:49:50,733
- That's not true.
- Right?

2223
01:49:50,807 --> 01:49:51,808
That's such a shame.

2224
01:49:51,887 --> 01:49:53,776
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.

2225
01:49:53,847 --> 01:49:55,497
- You don't know.
- What is yours?

2226
01:49:56,087 --> 01:49:57,134
I'm a Cancer.

2227
01:49:58,727 --> 01:49:59,933
- Really?
- Is that good?

2228
01:50:00,007 --> 01:50:01,168
What does it mean?

2229
01:50:01,287 --> 01:50:02,527
That's kind of strange. Well...

2230
01:50:02,647 --> 01:50:06,015
Taurus and Cancers are, sort
of, soul mates of the Zodiac.

2231
01:50:06,327 --> 01:50:08,329
We're, like,
perfectly compatible.

2232
01:50:08,407 --> 01:50:11,331
And I balance what you lack and
you make up for what I lack.

2233
01:50:11,407 --> 01:50:16,174
And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.

2234
01:50:17,847 --> 01:50:20,532
You're making me embarrassed.
Thank you.

2235
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:22,168
Thank you.

2236
01:50:22,487 --> 01:50:23,488
No. Fantastic.

2237
01:50:23,647 --> 01:50:25,490
Oh, I wanted to make a toast.

2238
01:50:26,047 --> 01:50:29,017
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you so much.

2239
01:50:29,367 --> 01:50:31,017
Pete's turning 40.

2240
01:50:31,087 --> 01:50:32,134
Weird.

2241
01:50:32,287 --> 01:50:35,848
And we're ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open hearts.

2242
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:39,967
Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody.

2243
01:50:40,807 --> 01:50:42,571
So, thank you all for coming.

2244
01:50:43,607 --> 01:50:45,371
Wait. Forgive who?

2245
01:50:46,007 --> 01:50:48,374
I think she just
means in a general sense.

2246
01:50:48,447 --> 01:50:51,178
You know, just put
the past behind us...

2247
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:52,688
And live without resentment.

2248
01:50:52,847 --> 01:50:55,293
But, specifically,
who are you forgiving?

2249
01:50:55,407 --> 01:50:58,616
I just like to know the details
before I make a toast.

2250
01:50:58,887 --> 01:51:03,370
Right. You and my dad
and, you know, others.

2251
01:51:05,007 --> 01:51:06,054
I see.

2252
01:51:07,767 --> 01:51:10,338
Well, I know you have
some issues with me,

2253
01:51:10,407 --> 01:51:12,455
but I'm curious,
what's he in for?

2254
01:51:12,567 --> 01:51:14,808
Before today, nobody
even knew he existed.

2255
01:51:14,887 --> 01:51:17,288
Well, my parents divorced
when I was really young

2256
01:51:17,367 --> 01:51:20,211
and we don't spend much time together
and I'd like to work on that.

2257
01:51:20,367 --> 01:51:23,735
Just like we
would like to work on

2258
01:51:24,967 --> 01:51:27,891
how you have financial issues.

2259
01:51:28,047 --> 01:51:30,698
She's talking about all the
lending and the borrowing and...

2260
01:51:30,807 --> 01:51:32,730
I know what she meant.

2261
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:38,058
You are a beautiful woman, but
you are not totally maxed out.

2262
01:51:38,327 --> 01:51:40,329
I would say,
honestly, you're a six.

2263
01:51:40,407 --> 01:51:42,250
A six-and-a-half.

2264
01:51:43,007 --> 01:51:44,930
- I could make you an 11.
- Really?

2265
01:51:45,007 --> 01:51:47,055
When I found Deb, she was a 7.

2266
01:51:47,327 --> 01:51:48,533
And now she's a 12.

2267
01:51:48,687 --> 01:51:50,416
I wanna be a 12.

2268
01:51:50,647 --> 01:51:52,407
- You can't be lazy.
- I don't wanna be lazy.

2269
01:51:52,487 --> 01:51:54,649
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.

2270
01:51:54,887 --> 01:51:55,968
I won't be lazy.

2271
01:51:56,287 --> 01:51:57,857
- Do you know how she got her body?
- How?

2272
01:51:57,927 --> 01:51:59,691
Bodies by Jason.

2273
01:51:59,767 --> 01:52:01,451
- Say it.
- Bodies by Jason.

2274
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:03,735
- Say it again.
- Bodies by Jason.

2275
01:52:03,927 --> 01:52:05,531
And now just say, "Jason"
Jason.

2276
01:52:05,767 --> 01:52:06,893
- Again.
- Jason.

2277
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:08,167
That sounds right, doesn't it?

2278
01:52:08,887 --> 01:52:09,934
Yeah.

2279
01:52:12,167 --> 01:52:14,693
What the fuck is
happening right now?

2280
01:52:15,567 --> 01:52:17,615
When was the last time you two
saw each other? I'm curious.

2281
01:52:17,727 --> 01:52:20,014
Actually, we had lunch
together last week.

2282
01:52:20,207 --> 01:52:21,254
And before that?

2283
01:52:21,567 --> 01:52:22,978
It's been about seven years.

2284
01:52:23,207 --> 01:52:25,414
Seven years?
That's a joke, right?

2285
01:52:25,487 --> 01:52:26,613
That's like two Olympics.

2286
01:52:27,007 --> 01:52:28,088
But I'm the bad guy.

2287
01:52:28,287 --> 01:52:29,334
All right, Dad.

2288
01:52:29,407 --> 01:52:33,935
What Debbie doesn't understand is
it's not bad to help out a parent.

2289
01:52:34,007 --> 01:52:37,011
And it's certainly not bad for
a parent to help out a child.

2290
01:52:37,367 --> 01:52:39,176
- I'm sure Oliver would agree.
- Well...

2291
01:52:39,287 --> 01:52:40,448
Are you really
doing this right now?

2292
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:42,575
Am I doing what?
I didn't start the toast.

2293
01:52:42,768 --> 01:52:44,816
Are you really about to
hit up my dad for money?

2294
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,976
What? He does four
operations a day.

2295
01:52:47,088 --> 01:52:48,852
It's perfect.
It helps everybody

2296
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:51,693
and it relieves his guilt from
all the abandonment issues.

2297
01:52:51,808 --> 01:52:54,334
You can't buy forgiveness.
Right, Pete?

2298
01:52:54,928 --> 01:52:57,488
I don't think anyone is looking for handouts.
I mean, you know...

2299
01:52:58,288 --> 01:52:59,494
We'd pay him back.

2300
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:02,856
If you two are in a bind, I'd
be more than happy to help.

2301
01:53:03,608 --> 01:53:07,010
No. It's not good to borrow
money from family members

2302
01:53:07,368 --> 01:53:10,611
because it causes resentment.
Remember?

2303
01:53:10,728 --> 01:53:11,889
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2304
01:53:12,688 --> 01:53:15,897
What do you want me to do? Okay.
Admit that my life is shit?

2305
01:53:16,128 --> 01:53:17,698
Is that what you want
me to say? You happy?

2306
01:53:17,768 --> 01:53:21,215
Aren't I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to have?

2307
01:53:22,008 --> 01:53:24,978
You have never once stopped
asking us for money.

2308
01:53:25,168 --> 01:53:27,375
Family helps family.

2309
01:53:27,528 --> 01:53:29,178
It's true. Family helps family.

2310
01:53:30,168 --> 01:53:33,172
Look, I don't expect
you to fully understand.

2311
01:53:33,648 --> 01:53:35,650
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.

2312
01:53:35,728 --> 01:53:37,537
It's not your fault
you can't feel love.

2313
01:53:37,928 --> 01:53:39,930
There's something
that you can't...

2314
01:53:41,048 --> 01:53:42,288
This is coming out wrong.

2315
01:53:43,928 --> 01:53:46,693
You know what? I would rather
have my dad than your dad.

2316
01:53:47,408 --> 01:53:49,297
Because he
doesn't drive me crazy.

2317
01:53:49,368 --> 01:53:51,336
You know what's the best
quality my father has?

2318
01:53:51,528 --> 01:53:53,132
Is he asks for nothing.

2319
01:53:54,728 --> 01:53:57,049
I don't know what the fuck
he's thinking right now.

2320
01:53:57,408 --> 01:54:00,378
Look at that. Nothing. Nothing.

2321
01:54:00,648 --> 01:54:01,774
I don't even know him.

2322
01:54:01,848 --> 01:54:05,409
And I turned out perfectly
fine without his input, okay?

2323
01:54:06,008 --> 01:54:09,774
I just figured out
what your problem is.

2324
01:54:10,408 --> 01:54:11,773
You hate Jews.

2325
01:54:13,248 --> 01:54:15,330
Which is so odd because
your children are Jewish.

2326
01:54:15,408 --> 01:54:16,773
Don't play the Jew card, Larry.

2327
01:54:16,928 --> 01:54:19,329
- I'm not playing any Jew card.
- Seriously, it's used up.

2328
01:54:19,408 --> 01:54:22,491
You can't use up a Jew card. That's
the whole point of a Jew card.

2329
01:54:22,688 --> 01:54:25,089
That's right. You can't use
it up, it goes forever.

2330
01:54:25,248 --> 01:54:27,410
You know what? I have to go.

2331
01:54:27,688 --> 01:54:29,531
Yeah, great.
What a big surprise.

2332
01:54:29,648 --> 01:54:32,891
Bye, Oliver. See you later. See
you in another seven years.

2333
01:54:33,008 --> 01:54:35,408
Make sure and say goodbye to the
grandkids who you met today.

2334
01:54:35,528 --> 01:54:37,496
You know, nothing I do
is right because of you.

2335
01:54:37,968 --> 01:54:41,211
Nothing. No matter how hard I
try, I'm just the asshole here.

2336
01:54:41,288 --> 01:54:42,892
But you know what?
You know what I realized?

2337
01:54:42,968 --> 01:54:44,652
It's you. You're the asshole.

2338
01:54:45,928 --> 01:54:47,532
Good luck working that out.

2339
01:54:47,768 --> 01:54:50,248
Happy birthday,
and go fuck yourself.

2340
01:54:50,968 --> 01:54:53,539
Hey, see you when
the Cubs win the pennant.

2341
01:54:54,248 --> 01:54:57,331
I'm gonna go light the candles.
Just get it going, okay?

2342
01:54:58,328 --> 01:55:01,009
- Maybe we should try the toast again.
- You know, can you be quiet?

2343
01:55:01,448 --> 01:55:03,212
You just threw
me under the bus.

2344
01:55:03,288 --> 01:55:05,177
- No, I don't...
- You threw me under the...

2345
01:55:05,328 --> 01:55:06,773
You threw me under the bus.

2346
01:55:07,128 --> 01:55:09,017
We agreed to let go
and forgive,

2347
01:55:09,088 --> 01:55:11,614
but then you started ripping
into my dad like a crazy person.

2348
01:55:11,808 --> 01:55:13,651
I'm not ripping into your dad.

2349
01:55:13,768 --> 01:55:17,056
I'm just saying to him
what you say to me.

2350
01:55:17,128 --> 01:55:18,449
Don't be such a ball-buster.

2351
01:55:18,528 --> 01:55:21,577
I am not a ball-buster.
You make me one.

2352
01:55:21,648 --> 01:55:24,652
I am a fun girl.
I am fun-loving.

2353
01:55:25,008 --> 01:55:28,410
I am a "Good-Time Sally."
I dance hip-hop.

2354
01:55:28,728 --> 01:55:31,652
I cannot believe I
have wasted my whole life

2355
01:55:31,768 --> 01:55:34,499
busting the balls of
people who have no balls.

2356
01:55:35,328 --> 01:55:38,013
I'm the only one
here who has any balls!

2357
01:56:20,609 --> 01:56:22,134
God damn it.

2358
01:56:25,409 --> 01:56:26,490
Mom?

2359
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:31,253
Mom? What are you doing?

2360
01:56:31,329 --> 01:56:32,330
What?

2361
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:34,730
You're smoking,
and in the front yard?

2362
01:56:34,849 --> 01:56:37,773
No! No, they're Barb's.

2363
01:56:40,129 --> 01:56:41,210
Mom!

2364
01:56:41,489 --> 01:56:43,378
Since when have
you been a smoker?

2365
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:44,530
I'm not a smoker.

2366
01:56:44,649 --> 01:56:46,139
I thought you said smokers die.

2367
01:56:46,209 --> 01:56:48,291
I'm not smoking.
I wasn't smoking.

2368
01:56:48,369 --> 01:56:49,416
I saw you.

2369
01:56:49,529 --> 01:56:50,530
No, I wasn't.

2370
01:56:50,609 --> 01:56:52,054
Mom, you're smoking?

2371
01:56:52,409 --> 01:56:55,015
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant.
You've been doing so well.

2372
01:56:55,089 --> 01:56:56,250
You're pregnant?

2373
01:56:56,569 --> 01:56:59,140
No effing way. I don't
want another sister.

2374
01:56:59,249 --> 01:57:00,455
I don't want her as a sister.

2375
01:57:01,049 --> 01:57:03,336
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
It just slipped out.

2376
01:57:03,689 --> 01:57:04,975
Are you pregnant? Since
when are you pregnant?

2377
01:57:05,089 --> 01:57:07,820
Since when do you care? You
don't even want another baby.

2378
01:57:08,249 --> 01:57:09,660
You have no idea what I want.

2379
01:57:09,729 --> 01:57:11,060
I want an Asian baby.

2380
01:57:11,169 --> 01:57:12,580
We're not gonna
have an Asian baby.

2381
01:57:12,649 --> 01:57:13,650
Yes, We are.

2382
01:57:13,729 --> 01:57:15,140
- They're not Asian.
- Sadie.

2383
01:57:15,209 --> 01:57:17,052
- We'll buy one.
- Shut up, Charlotte.

2384
01:57:17,129 --> 01:57:18,574
- You shut up.
- Shut up, Sadie!

2385
01:57:18,769 --> 01:57:20,259
- Shut up, Charlotte!
- Shut up!

2386
01:57:20,449 --> 01:57:22,417
- Okay, Sadie, shut up.
- Shut up, Charlotte!

2387
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:24,133
- Shut up!
- Okay, stop saying "shut up"!

2388
01:57:24,209 --> 01:57:25,969
You're pregnant?
Since when are you pregnant?

2389
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:28,178
When did you find out?

2390
01:57:29,689 --> 01:57:33,057
Will you stop
eating cupcakes, please?

2391
01:57:33,569 --> 01:57:37,779
Stop eating cupcakes!
Stop eating cupcakes!

2392
01:57:41,489 --> 01:57:45,460
Hey, we just heard.
You're having a baby?

2393
01:57:45,569 --> 01:57:47,253
See, it can happen to anybody.

2394
01:57:47,329 --> 01:57:49,297
That is so wonderful.

2395
01:57:49,369 --> 01:57:52,373
Let me give you a hug.
Fantastic, congratulations.

2396
01:57:52,529 --> 01:57:54,289
It's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

2397
01:57:58,049 --> 01:57:59,858
This is too adult for you.
Let's go outside.

2398
01:58:00,169 --> 01:58:01,500
Congratulations.

2399
01:58:03,809 --> 01:58:06,380
Well, I guess we're stuck together
then forever then, right?

2400
01:58:06,449 --> 01:58:07,450
Weren't we always?

2401
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:08,889
You didn't even want a baby.

2402
01:58:08,969 --> 01:58:10,971
Of course I do.
I never said that.

2403
01:58:11,289 --> 01:58:13,291
I didn't want one
if I could choose.

2404
01:58:13,369 --> 01:58:15,815
I should put that on a Hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

2405
01:58:16,129 --> 01:58:17,176
Debbie...

2406
01:58:17,809 --> 01:58:19,698
Good luck with
the pregnancy, Debbie.

2407
01:58:19,769 --> 01:58:21,658
But please,
take care of yourself.

2408
01:58:21,729 --> 01:58:23,697
It's a much riskier
pregnancy after 40.

2409
01:58:24,089 --> 01:58:25,659
- I'm not 40.
- Of course you are.

2410
01:58:25,929 --> 01:58:28,773
You were born on
December 5th, 1972.

2411
01:58:28,849 --> 01:58:31,295
I'm not 40. How do you know?

2412
01:58:31,369 --> 01:58:34,179
I was there. I'm the one who took
your mother to the hospital.

2413
01:58:34,289 --> 01:58:35,529
Well, that's not what she said.

2414
01:58:35,689 --> 01:58:38,169
Your mother was in labor
for only about 20 minutes.

2415
01:58:38,329 --> 01:58:41,060
You couldn't wait to meet me.
Can you imagine that?

2416
01:58:41,249 --> 01:58:42,660
I don't even know you.

2417
01:58:42,849 --> 01:58:46,934
You can't just come into
my house and reminisce.

2418
01:58:47,169 --> 01:58:50,218
Look, maybe we're just not meant
to be in each other's lives.

2419
01:58:50,569 --> 01:58:53,254
I'm not sure this
was such a great idea.

2420
01:58:56,489 --> 01:58:58,856
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute!

2421
01:58:59,089 --> 01:59:01,854
You did leave and
you didn't come back.

2422
01:59:02,129 --> 01:59:05,690
My first life was ruined.
I did my best with my second.

2423
01:59:05,849 --> 01:59:08,295
So, I ruined your life?
I was eight.

2424
01:59:08,369 --> 01:59:10,292
People do better when I
stay out of their lives!

2425
01:59:10,369 --> 01:59:11,655
That's what my son tells me.

2426
01:59:11,969 --> 01:59:13,539
You think my
life is so perfect?

2427
01:59:13,609 --> 01:59:16,135
I've got a 13-year-old
who's a pothead.

2428
01:59:16,209 --> 01:59:20,259
I've got a wife who's
keeping Zoloft alive.

2429
01:59:20,649 --> 01:59:22,014
You never said that before.

2430
01:59:22,169 --> 01:59:25,139
You don't think I wanna talk to you
about this, to share it with you?

2431
01:59:25,209 --> 01:59:27,132
It's just not our way.
We don't talk to each other.

2432
01:59:27,209 --> 01:59:30,372
We don't know each other. And I
thought that's the way you wanted it.

2433
01:59:31,049 --> 01:59:32,699
How do I get out of this?

2434
01:59:32,769 --> 01:59:36,660
How do I get you all to just
help me down off the cross?

2435
01:59:38,729 --> 01:59:40,174
You sound just like Sadie.

2436
01:59:40,369 --> 01:59:41,416
Who's Sadie?

2437
01:59:41,529 --> 01:59:43,930
No, your daughter.
Your younger?

2438
01:59:44,049 --> 01:59:45,016
The big one.

2439
01:59:45,089 --> 01:59:48,571
Your older. I know, I know that.
A wonderful girl.

2440
01:59:49,369 --> 01:59:52,213
Hey, guys,
some of us need to leave.

2441
01:59:52,529 --> 01:59:55,260
Would this be a good
moment to sneak out?

2442
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:00,459
Where is Dad going?

2443
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:12,254
Best birthday ever!

2444
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:20,179
Oh, shit!

2445
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:21,331
Bike lane, asshole!

2446
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:24,613
Fuck you, you Twilight
pimply-ass motherfuckers!

2447
02:00:25,650 --> 02:00:27,573
Your dad's still here.

2448
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:30,410
I know. It's kind of weird.

2449
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,459
Where the hell is Pete?

2450
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,531
Is it okay if Joseph
hangs out here for a while?

2451
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:42,257
Hi, Joseph.

2452
02:00:42,650 --> 02:00:43,697
Hi.

2453
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:46,091
Do you want a piece of cake?

2454
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:49,021
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2455
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:53,291
All right, then.

2456
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,336
They are so cute.

2457
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:56,457
So cute.

2458
02:00:56,570 --> 02:00:57,981
He looks exactly
like Tom Petty.

2459
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:06,015
Go around.

2460
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:11,461
Watch it, watch it!

2461
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,651
Hey, Pete! Great party!

2462
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:21,011
Yeah.

2463
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:23,496
The best!

2464
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:25,450
And then we shake it.

2465
02:01:26,190 --> 02:01:27,731
And then a restaurant comes up.

2466
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:31,893
Dad, excuse me. I'm gonna
go look for Pete right now.

2467
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:34,781
Would you mind staying with the
girls for just a little bit?

2468
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:36,331
Well, if you want me to.

2469
02:01:36,410 --> 02:01:38,014
If you don't mind.
You don't have to.

2470
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:39,336
Sure.

2471
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:43,336
Can I let Sadie show me
the last episode of <i>Lost?</i>

2472
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:44,861
She asked me if I'd
seen it and I haven't.

2473
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:46,251
Yeah, that would be nice.

2474
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,499
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2475
02:01:50,170 --> 02:01:52,696
She said we could watch it.
Come on.

2476
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:56,941
I'm gonna let you
watch <i>Lost.</i> Come on.

2477
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:00,216
Is it scary?

2478
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:02,737
I'll cover your eyes
if it gets too scary.

2479
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:36,658
Are you mad at me?
Did I say something?

2480
02:02:36,730 --> 02:02:38,016
Larry, please.

2481
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:54,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

2482
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:57,538
Are you fucking kidding me?

2483
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:00,340
You opened your door on me.

2484
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:03,096
I didn't open my fucking door on you.
I opened my door!

2485
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:05,772
Fuck. I was right there!

2486
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:08,292
You're supposed to look
before you open your door!

2487
02:03:08,410 --> 02:03:09,696
I was in a fucking bike path!

2488
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:11,852
That's a blind spot.
There's no fucking bike path.

2489
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:14,211
It's a residential section.
Get your head out of your ass.

2490
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,291
Pay attention!

2491
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:16,940
Open your goddamn eyes. What
are you doing, sleepwalking?

2492
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:20,578
You're supposed to look to see
if a biker's coming through.

2493
02:03:20,650 --> 02:03:21,697
You're supposed to look!

2494
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:24,137
It's not my job to look out for you.
You look out for yourself.

2495
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:25,850
I don't look out for you.
I don't see you.

2496
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:28,098
I don't know where the fuck
you are or what you're doing.

2497
02:03:28,210 --> 02:03:30,451
No one is ever
looking out for me!

2498
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:32,971
I need your name
and your number.

2499
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:34,131
Why?

2500
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:35,257
Because you're
gonna pay for my door.

2501
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:36,452
Fuck you!

2502
02:03:36,571 --> 02:03:39,973
Why don't you pay for my bike
and my face, you fucking prick?

2503
02:03:46,991 --> 02:03:47,981
Don't disrespect me.

2504
02:03:51,371 --> 02:03:52,657
Are you sure that's him?

2505
02:03:53,331 --> 02:03:55,015
I don't think that's him.

2506
02:03:57,811 --> 02:03:59,654
I gotta write down
your license plate.

2507
02:04:04,571 --> 02:04:07,302
"Range Rover of Sunland."

2508
02:04:10,571 --> 02:04:11,699
What are you doing?

2509
02:04:19,611 --> 02:04:22,854
I guess the party didn't
turn out like you planned.

2510
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:25,974
It wasn't a good party.

2511
02:04:27,171 --> 02:04:28,218
- Hi.
- Hi.

2512
02:04:28,291 --> 02:04:29,941
I'll bring you in as soon
as his X-rays are finished.

2513
02:04:30,011 --> 02:04:31,615
- Okay. Is he okay?
- Okay.

2514
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:34,616
Yeah, he has a broken rib and
he's been crying a little bit.

2515
02:04:34,691 --> 02:04:36,375
But he'll be fine.

2516
02:04:38,411 --> 02:04:42,018
You know, Pete was
never a real fighter.

2517
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:46,292
But that's why he married you.
That's why he loves you.

2518
02:04:46,371 --> 02:04:48,373
Because you're the fighter.

2519
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:50,458
And you need that.

2520
02:04:50,531 --> 02:04:53,501
One person in a relationship
has got to punch.

2521
02:04:54,371 --> 02:04:55,657
Do you mean that in a good way?

2522
02:04:55,851 --> 02:04:58,900
Oh, it's a high compliment.

2523
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:02,497
Thanks.

2524
02:05:04,011 --> 02:05:05,612
Listen, I know what
you're worried about.

2525
02:05:05,891 --> 02:05:08,132
You think he's
gonna turn into me,

2526
02:05:09,091 --> 02:05:10,581
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

2527
02:05:10,811 --> 02:05:13,860
He's smarter and
probably a little cuter.

2528
02:05:15,051 --> 02:05:16,860
A little less Jew-y.

2529
02:05:17,331 --> 02:05:20,540
Although after 50,
that's all gonna change.

2530
02:05:20,691 --> 02:05:23,581
Be prepared to wake up
one day with a rabbi.

2531
02:05:24,531 --> 02:05:26,852
But the good news is, you know,

2532
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:29,337
he'll love you forever.

2533
02:05:29,411 --> 02:05:31,140
That's in our DNA.

2534
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:33,175
We stick around.

2535
02:05:34,731 --> 02:05:36,699
He worries about you, you know.

2536
02:05:36,771 --> 02:05:38,500
It puts a lot of
pressure on him.

2537
02:05:38,571 --> 02:05:41,256
I know, I just don't have anyone
else to talk to about it.

2538
02:05:41,331 --> 02:05:42,776
Why don't you talk to Claire?

2539
02:05:42,851 --> 02:05:44,933
If I open up to her,
she'll leave me.

2540
02:05:45,171 --> 02:05:46,332
No, she won't.

2541
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:48,254
Larry, she loves you.

2542
02:05:48,331 --> 02:05:51,699
I know, but there's a certain point
at which you just can't stay.

2543
02:05:56,091 --> 02:05:57,581
I guess it's hard
to forgive somebody

2544
02:05:57,651 --> 02:06:00,302
if they don't
formally apologize to you.

2545
02:06:04,611 --> 02:06:05,851
Are you apologizing?

2546
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:09,138
I'm very close.

2547
02:06:10,811 --> 02:06:12,381
Yes, I'm sorry.

2548
02:06:18,491 --> 02:06:20,539
I'm glad everybody's okay.

2549
02:06:21,371 --> 02:06:22,497
Okay, thanks.

2550
02:06:22,571 --> 02:06:24,573
Oh, thank you.

2551
02:06:31,411 --> 02:06:32,936
All right, I'm off.

2552
02:06:33,011 --> 02:06:34,137
Okay.

2553
02:06:35,891 --> 02:06:37,131
This is awkward.

2554
02:06:38,011 --> 02:06:39,058
What?

2555
02:06:39,131 --> 02:06:41,133
I need $40 for a cab.

2556
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:44,020
That's funny.

2557
02:06:44,731 --> 02:06:45,812
No, I'm not kidding.

2558
02:06:46,451 --> 02:06:47,498
Oh, yeah.

2559
02:06:47,691 --> 02:06:49,455
You drove me, honey.
I wasn't prepared.

2560
02:06:49,691 --> 02:06:51,739
I know. I only have a hundred.

2561
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:52,858
It's okay.

2562
02:06:53,851 --> 02:06:55,933
I'll bring you the change.

2563
02:06:56,651 --> 02:06:59,097
All right.
Give him a kiss for me.

2564
02:07:18,412 --> 02:07:20,460
I don't get it.

2565
02:07:20,932 --> 02:07:22,297
See, it's not sad.

2566
02:07:22,412 --> 02:07:26,383
It's happy, because they helped
each other achieve their destiny.

2567
02:07:27,692 --> 02:07:31,253
Great. I'm gonna have
some freaky-ass nightmares.

2568
02:07:43,452 --> 02:07:45,216
- Hi.
- Hi.

2569
02:07:55,132 --> 02:07:56,861
I really liked our
life so much better

2570
02:07:56,932 --> 02:07:59,458
before we tried to
change everything.

2571
02:08:00,132 --> 02:08:01,497
I'm sorry.

2572
02:08:01,892 --> 02:08:05,817
No, I'm sorry. I don't want
to keep anything from you.

2573
02:08:07,092 --> 02:08:08,776
I love you, you're my wife.

2574
02:08:09,372 --> 02:08:11,773
I just didn't
want to let you down.

2575
02:08:13,092 --> 02:08:14,617
Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

2576
02:08:14,852 --> 02:08:17,583
No. I'm not mad, I'm thrilled.

2577
02:08:18,052 --> 02:08:19,213
You don't feel trapped?

2578
02:08:20,092 --> 02:08:22,015
I sometimes feel
like I trapped you.

2579
02:08:22,092 --> 02:08:23,582
I don't feel trapped.

2580
02:08:23,932 --> 02:08:25,297
- Really?
- No.

2581
02:08:25,492 --> 02:08:27,494
You should,
because I have trapped you.

2582
02:08:27,572 --> 02:08:28,573
You can't go anywhere.

2583
02:08:29,572 --> 02:08:32,178
I'm gonna get you pregnant every 10
years for the rest of your life.

2584
02:08:32,252 --> 02:08:34,414
You can never leave me. Ever.

2585
02:08:34,572 --> 02:08:36,256
I never feel trapped by you.

2586
02:08:36,332 --> 02:08:39,620
I'm so happy to be with you
and I love you so much.

2587
02:08:40,092 --> 02:08:43,016
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

2588
02:08:43,532 --> 02:08:46,103
God damn it, why am
I crying like this?

2589
02:08:46,572 --> 02:08:48,062
Something is wrong with me.

2590
02:08:48,452 --> 02:08:49,658
You're pregnant.

2591
02:08:49,812 --> 02:08:51,098
Oh, yeah.

2592
02:08:51,452 --> 02:08:52,533
Shit.

2593
02:08:53,252 --> 02:08:56,335
I was just outside telling
your dad that I liked him.

2594
02:08:56,412 --> 02:08:58,221
What if he
thinks I like him now?

2595
02:08:58,292 --> 02:08:59,293
No, he won't think that.

2596
02:08:59,372 --> 02:09:01,534
I don't want him to think
I like him that much.

2597
02:09:01,612 --> 02:09:03,137
No, it will never happen.

2598
02:09:03,892 --> 02:09:07,817
Can you believe it? This is
the craziest thing ever.

2599
02:09:07,892 --> 02:09:10,179
What are we gonna do
with a third baby?

2600
02:09:10,412 --> 02:09:12,653
I have no idea.
How are we going to afford it?

2601
02:09:13,532 --> 02:09:14,738
We'll sell the house.

2602
02:09:15,172 --> 02:09:16,333
We don't have to.

2603
02:09:16,412 --> 02:09:18,255
- We kind of do.
- We kind of do.

2604
02:09:18,452 --> 02:09:20,659
We'll make new memories
in a new house.

2605
02:09:21,652 --> 02:09:22,778
I love you.

2606
02:09:24,972 --> 02:09:27,498
Is there anything you want
to do for your birthday?

2607
02:09:27,572 --> 02:09:29,734
It's been the worst
birthday ever.

2608
02:09:30,812 --> 02:09:32,892
There is one thing, but I
don't think you'll like it.

2609
02:09:33,172 --> 02:09:34,458
What?

2610
02:09:34,572 --> 02:09:37,815
I wouldn't mind going to see some music.
Would you want to do that?

2611
02:09:38,132 --> 02:09:39,133
Yeah.

2612
02:09:39,212 --> 02:09:40,259
- Really?
- Yeah.

2613
02:09:40,332 --> 02:09:42,539
I don't believe you, but
you're sweet for saying that.

2614
02:09:42,932 --> 02:09:44,616
How do we break
you out of here?

2615
02:09:44,732 --> 02:09:47,463
I can just leave on my own volition.
It's not a mental institution.

2616
02:09:47,932 --> 02:09:49,582
- Can you?
- Yes.

2617
02:09:49,652 --> 02:09:51,453
It's not like <i>One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

2618
02:09:52,252 --> 02:09:53,772
Please don't put
a pillow over my face.

2619
02:09:56,332 --> 02:09:57,572
Let's get outta here, McMurphy.

2620
02:09:57,652 --> 02:09:58,653
You got it, Chief.

2621
02:09:58,852 --> 02:10:00,536
Will you carry me?

2622
02:10:01,492 --> 02:10:03,335
You've been carrying me
all this time.

2623
02:10:34,372 --> 02:10:35,533
Thanks.

2624
02:10:43,212 --> 02:10:44,862
I like this song.

2625
02:10:45,692 --> 02:10:46,898
Really?

2626
02:10:47,612 --> 02:10:48,693
Why?

2627
02:10:53,813 --> 02:10:55,338
Why don't you sign him?

2628
02:10:55,413 --> 02:10:59,134
Ryan Adams?
No, he wouldn't sign with me.

2629
02:10:59,493 --> 02:11:01,302
Why not? You're the best.

2630
02:11:01,893 --> 02:11:02,894
He is in between labels.

2631
02:11:05,533 --> 02:11:07,342
Let's go try and talk
to him after the show.

2632
02:11:59,413 --> 02:12:01,017
Thank you.

2633
02:12:34,333 --> 02:12:37,337
I'm sorry if I'm not all
fancy pants and wealthy

2634
02:12:37,453 --> 02:12:40,935
and showing it all off with
my Vidal Sassoon haircuts.

2635
02:12:41,493 --> 02:12:42,494
Sorry.

2636
02:12:42,813 --> 02:12:44,338
Quit slow-blinking at me.

2637
02:12:44,853 --> 02:12:46,184
- I'm sorry.
- Okay...

2638
02:12:46,813 --> 02:12:49,817
I would like to rear
up and jackknife my legs

2639
02:12:49,893 --> 02:12:52,863
and kick you both in the
fucking jaw with my foot bone.

2640
02:12:55,133 --> 02:12:57,215
That's what I
would fucking love.

2641
02:12:57,333 --> 02:13:00,860
I wish my fucking foot would
go right through your skull.

2642
02:13:01,933 --> 02:13:04,300
This is what happens
when you corner a rat.

2643
02:13:04,373 --> 02:13:05,534
I will fucking kill you.

2644
02:13:05,853 --> 02:13:08,538
You corner me, I will
fucking chew through you.

2645
02:13:08,693 --> 02:13:09,899
I'll chew through you!

2646
02:13:10,133 --> 02:13:13,694
Slow-blinking eyes. I will
chew off your fucking eyelids.

2647
02:13:14,133 --> 02:13:15,703
You won't slow-blink
at me, will you?

2648
02:13:15,853 --> 02:13:17,537
Did you drink
before you came here?

2649
02:13:17,613 --> 02:13:19,741
No, but I'm gonna
start drinking.

2650
02:13:19,933 --> 02:13:23,301
I'm gonna slit somebody open like
a fish and drink their blood.

2651
02:13:23,373 --> 02:13:24,738
That's what I'm gonna drink

2652
02:13:24,933 --> 02:13:27,937
if we don't start getting
to the fucking point here.

2653
02:13:28,373 --> 02:13:30,614
Probably I'm gonna start
with Karen Carpenter's head.

2654
02:13:31,213 --> 02:13:34,820
I'm gonna rip her head off
and I'm gonna drink her blood.

2655
02:13:35,093 --> 02:13:37,093
And then I'm gonna come back
and light you on fire.

2656
02:13:38,453 --> 02:13:39,818
I'm gonna light
you all on fire.

2657
02:13:39,893 --> 02:13:41,736
But I'm gonna
start with you, Jill.

2658
02:13:42,013 --> 02:13:43,253
I'm gonna fucking torch you.

2659
02:13:43,693 --> 02:13:46,936
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go buy a fucking pickup truck.

2660
02:13:47,013 --> 02:13:48,219
And a cord of rope.

2661
02:13:48,293 --> 02:13:50,455
And I'm gonna string it around
all three of your fucking necks

2662
02:13:50,533 --> 02:13:52,376
and then drive
around town, dragging you.

2663
02:13:52,493 --> 02:13:53,699
That's what I'm
gonna fucking do.

2664
02:13:53,773 --> 02:13:56,014
That's completely uncalled for.

2665
02:13:56,253 --> 02:13:58,859
Really, Jill?
Do you think it is?

2666
02:13:59,133 --> 02:14:02,296
Fuck off, Jill. God,
everybody fucking hates you.

2667
02:14:02,973 --> 02:14:03,974
God!

2668
02:14:04,053 --> 02:14:05,100
That isn't even nice.

2669
02:14:05,253 --> 02:14:08,302
Go suck a big
fucking dick, Jill.

2670
02:14:09,133 --> 02:14:10,544
That's totally
uncalled for, Catherine.

2671
02:14:10,613 --> 02:14:12,900
You're a fucking asshole.
Everybody hates you.

2672
02:14:13,013 --> 02:14:14,174
They hate your fucking bob.

2673
02:14:15,333 --> 02:14:17,495
And I'm glad your husband died.

2674
02:14:17,693 --> 02:14:20,902
Because you're a fucking asshole.
He probably killed himself.

2675
02:14:21,813 --> 02:14:23,815
I would. Kill myself.

2676
02:14:24,613 --> 02:14:26,820
God, I'd kill myself, Jill.

2677
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:30,862
Cut!
